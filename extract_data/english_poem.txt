Through hundred years in life
Talent and Fate are twined in hate
Through changes in one's fate
Seen things to hearts relay sorrows
Counterpoise's law all know
Heaven envies the rosy-cheeked
Pages lamp shines over
Tell a romance covered in scrolls
In Jia Jing's Ming of old
At peace both capitals stood high
There lived noble Vương clan
Whose wealth prestige was then modest
Vương Quan the heir youngest
Followed customs harnessed honors
Blessed too with fair daughters
Elder Thúy Kiều younger Thúy Vân
Lithe frames pure hearts were sung
Each born with perfect wondrous grace
Vân's elegance surfaced
Plump moth-feeler brows face Moon-round
Smiles voice - blooms gems endowed
Clouds praised her hair snow gowned her skin
Kiều far surpassed her kin
Her skills and charms both dimmed Vân's shines
Spring-hill brows Fall-stream eyes
Willows begrudged blooms sighed envied
Glance made kingdom shaky
Flair few might match beauty none could
She was born smart and shrewd
Verse paint songs lute she knew them all
Knew well music's five tones
Lute's strings she plucked outshone others'
Old tunes formed new number
Bleak Fate she stroked quavered all souls
Fair red-trouser well-known
Prime spring she'd reached to hold suitor
Beyond discreet covers
East wall filled with wooers ignored
Spring came swallows soared high
Of ninety days gone by sixty
Grass dyed skylines greenly
Pearly pear branch donned wee blossoms
Qing Ming of March had come
People swept tombs and stomped grasslands
Midst gay pilgrims of lands
Siblings bought garbs held hands and strolled
Sirs and madams to fro
Vibrant garments mingled with wheels
Pell-mell hillocks stacked still
Papers alit round filled sham gold
Twilight would soon unfold
With hands entwined they'd go back home
Along a creek they'd roam
Admire landscapes' green-combed beauty
Round curled a brook gently
Beneath a bridge bitsy traveled
By trail stood one mound old
With withered weeds' raveled chartreuse
Why in Qing Ming Kiều mused
Incense here's naught Bemused I am
Vương Quan's answer then came
Here lies late songstress named Đạm Tiên
Grand talent with fine mien
Outside her steps men gleaned always
That branch Heaven's scents sprayed
Mid-spring broke off  dismay's sudden
Stranger from far nation
Her skills he'd heard entrance he gained
Love's boat at port met pain
Pin snapped vase smashed - in vain he'd tried
Her room was void of life
Horse wheels' left tracks dimmed by grown moss
He cried for his love lost
Ill fate tween them had caused rupture
This life love was severed
Next life his heart's reserved wholly
To coffin hearse he'd see
Beneath this earth slept she after
To grave without owner
Moon's phases passed never one came
Inner sadness inflamed
Pearl-like teardrops down went from Kiều
To sad fates women yield
Before life's woes we feel helpless
Creator's too callous
Green youth beauty vanish quickly
As people's bride lived she
Yet died as unmarried single
Where did embraces go
Where're admirers of old right now
Incense candles I shall
Light up and offer bows none will
We meet by chance but still
By Yellow Springs please feel my heart
Soft whispered prayers she'd start
Prostrate and bow toward lone tomb
On withered weeds dusk loomed
Winds swayed the tassels' blooms gently
Hairpin atop she'd seize
On tree's bark etch a few verse lines
To trance Kiều was inclined
She would not leave in silence stay
Shadows darkened her face
Sad tears flowed ebbed cascaded down
Vân said You do astound
With tears to spend around past soul
Kiều spoke Since time unknown
On us ill fate's shown no mercy
This thought stirs pains in me
Will her fate one day be my own
Quan said Your talk's forlorn
My ears hurt as you mourned for her
Cold air here has gathered
Dusk's set yet home's ever distant
Kiều spoke Those with talents
Bodies perish latent souls stay
Soulmate I've met this day
She may emerge just wait awhile
No answer was yet styled
A gust stormed forth meanwhile raving
Trees and buds were swaying
Scents were permeating with gale
After that wind they'd trail
Find prints on moss details crystal
Terrors dawned upon all
My prayer has been made known cried Kiều
We are soul-sisters still
Through life and death our wills gather
Kiều's words had been answered
As thanks she'd add further verse lines
Poet's sorrows formed tides
On tree a poem - old-styled - was writ
Dilemma - leave or stay
Twas then they heard bells played nearby
A young scholar passed by
Hands reined his filly ride loosely
Scrolls filled his bag fully
Behind him tagged tiny servants
Colt's fur snow dyed laden
Grass mixed with robe's Heaven's light blue
Spotted his face beamed hues
He'd fast dismount then move forward
Slippers split grass onward
Field seemed dazzling sparkler-endowed
While Quan hailed whom he'd found
Shy maidens hid midst shrouds of plants
He'd come from nearby land
Kim Trọng  heir to a grand noble
Both wealthy and able
Sky-born talent Earth-grown savvy
Fine in flair looks was he
Cultured inside stately outside
Because he lived nearby
He'd known Quan all his life from class
Of them his ears had grasped
Famed Tong Que Tower's trapped beauties
Of those midst veils privy
He'd thought and sometimes weaved faux dreams
Now luck on him had gleamed
He'd come and found esteemed flowers
Brief glimpse he had procured
Orchid daisy  alluring pair
State's fairest Heaven's flair
Though hearts approved eyes dared not say
Their minds were in a daze
Neither stayed nor in haste split paths
Looming sadness dusk cast
As he mounted shy lass glanced on
Clear stream gushed forth bygone
By bridge dusk-lit trees spawned sleek shades
Kiều had gone to her home
Curfew gong'd rung sun's chrome had fad'd
Bright Moon peeped through blinds' space
Trees' shades filled yard gold-laced waves roused
Eastward orchards' trees bowed
Spring branches were weighed down by dews
Moonbeams she'd mutely view
As countless thoughts imbued her mind
Ill-fated is her life
Wasted midst wealth delights it fades
Why did we meet this day
May our union take place or not
Her heart formed skeins of thoughts
A superb verse was wrought profound
Slant Moon shone on her shrouds
By sills sleep had her bound gently
Out of nowhere she'd see
A maiden with comely sleek grace
Snow-dyed frame mist-white face
Surreal lotus feet swayed slowly
Startled Kiều stood to greet
From which Peach Spring have ye here strayed
We're sworn soulmates she'd say
When the sun shone today we met
In cold home West I rest
Beneath a bridge down jett'd stream's flow
Few mourn this nether soul
Yet you sent me fine odic pearls
I showed my league leader
In Doom's Scroll woe's after your fate
All lives karma dictates
We share one boat one fate's suffered
On ten themes do ponder
Once more may brush confer magic
Kiều thought on said topics
One fey brush stroke lyrics tenfold
With awe Tiên would behold
These lines are like fine brocade spun
To this first prize is won
Within Doom's Scroll to none it yields
To porch Tiên turned her heels
Kiều begged to continue talking
Strong winds through blinds blew in
Twas then she woke  dreaming she'd been
Nowhere could Tiên be seen
Yet residual scents seemed to stay
She pondered though twas late
She'd feel for future fate worried
Adrift she knew she'd be
What Fate planned she did see just now
Like stirring waves thoughts roused
She mused over and bawled further
Sobs pierced phoenix shutters
What ails you asked mother woken
Fitful when night's darkened
With cheeks like blooms burdened by rain
You birthed raised me she strained
Two debts I've yet commenced to pay
Đạm Tiên I'd met today
In my brief sleep she'd paid visit
Doom's Scroll  just what is it
I wrote on sent topics some songs
My future shall be wronged
What dream's foretold I've long ciphered
False omen said mother
Why'd you search for dolor Just think
Kiều took her stern teaching
Torn she was then crying harder
Oriole's chirps were heard
Blown catkins flew over next-door
Slant Moonbeams on roof poured
Alone with her thoughts more she'd think
About the doting lot
None could cut their thin knotted wires
To study he'd retired
Thoughts of Kiều in Kim's mind still stayed
Gloom ebbed and flowed always
Three Falls equaled one day it seemed
Twas like clouds hid her screens
Hence to rose's bush he'd dream his way
Oil waned Moons went away
Heart yearned for heart his face missed hers
Bronze-cold air filled chamber
Brushes dried strings never tuned lied
Cool winds swayed bamboo blinds
Tea lacked love's taste scents sighed longing
Were love not destined think
Why'd such gorgeous grace sting my eyes
He missed that scene her sight
To where they'd met he'd stride swiftly
Grass dyed the earth wholly
Clear still water would greet his eyes
Dusk's breeze blew grief to mind
Reeds swayed back forth derided him
She filled his thoughts to brim
He'd seek Blue Bridge and skim onward
Grand gates blocked path forward
Stopped swayed red leaf blue bird's straight flight
Willows cast shades thread-like
Perched parrot spoke to chide lone soul
Gates shut bolts locked thorough
Midst bloom-filled step where though was she
He lingered round sadly
Behind one house he'd see standing
Twas a merchant's dwelling
Whose owner'd left trading elsewhere
As student he'd rent there
His lute and books he'd bear over
Trees thrived false hills covered
Roof had gold Green Garden's View carved
At that his joy would start
Heaven commands our hearts be twined
From room's window oblique
He'd view the east wall's sight daily
Nigh spring cave shut tightly
Her silhouette he'd see never
Since when he came over
Moon's movements had covered two rounds
One day o'er wall he found
One lithe form idling round peach trees
Lute dropped gown fixed dashed he
Scents were still there yet she was not
Around the walls he'd spot
A golden hairpin caught midst boughs
He'd reach and pull it down
From sealed chamber to out here - why
It's hers  Our fates are twined
If not how'd hands of mine hold this
Restless he'd view laud it
Residual scents still whizzed about
At dawn the girl was out
Wildly looking around her fence
Kim had waited since when
Words from his heart he'd then utter
Strange pin I've recovered
Whom shall I give this pearl back to
From wall Kiều's voice passed through
Unselfish soul thank you truly
It's worth little money
Yet your kindness's clearly ample
He said Why so civil
Strangers we're not at all neighbor
I owe dropped sweet odor
In torments I've suffered till now
Long waited day's come round
Please linger and announce your mind
He'd fetch things from inside
Twin gold bracelets textile square cloth
Tall ladder had bridge wrought
It was her  he had not a doubt
Abashed she seemed throughout
He'd gaze at her she'd shroud her face
Since we met he'd then say
Ceaseless yearning's surfaced in me
Thin frame's long grown fatigued
Who would have thought I'd see this day
Whole month I've sought your grace
Lovelorn I've risked this fate waiting
Please answer a few things
On moss is glass casting its shine
Timidly she'd reply
Though food's modest house's life's snow-pure
Red thread of mine and yours
Parents rule if it's sure or not
For frail one strong love's wrought
Yet I'm young thus cannot answer
Now wind next rain batters
This chance rarely occurs said he
If you reject love's plea
One's hurt yet one achieves nothing
Let us pledge with something
We'll plan a matchmaking later
If love's by Fate severed
Wasted youth shall wither at once
My feelings if you shun
Won't vain love lead this one astray
She harked sound words conveyed
Her shy eyes looked away intrigued
We're strangers you and me
Out of respect I'll heed your words
By me your heart's wavered
Etched on bronze stone never love fades
His joy gushed forth like waves
Gold pin rose cloth he gave to her
Here lifelong love's occurred
Take these as reminders he'd say
Silk cloth gold pin she'd trade
Give gold-etched fan away forthright
Firm oath was ratified
From backyard noises nigh they'd hear
They'd flee in haste in fear
He'd make for home she'd veer for hers
Since stone of gold's gleam learned
Ardor thickened minds yearned always
So near yet faraway
Yearning would not abate be drowned
Snow and mist had wall bound
Love's words could not get round freely
Days nights would supersede
Red waned green thrived Spring season gone
Maternal birthday dawned
Parents siblings were long ready
They'd prepared garbs comely
Bought gifts for the journey with them
At home Kiều stayed lonesome
A chance to meet had come lastly
With season's fruits ready
Lotus heels sprang swiftly to wall
From there a soft voice called
Midst flowers standing tall was he
Your heart cares not for me
Let flames incense recede and fade
Much dole longing I've faced
Half of my head's now jaded white
Kiều said Winds trap rains bind
By chance actions of mine hurt thee
This day my house's empty
I'll give apologies to you
Round false hills she passed through
A passage which seemed newly fenced
Sleeves rolled she'd free Peach Den
Tread clouds' path to fey realm of gods
Face to face joy burned hot
Greetings small talks they'd swop utter
To study they'd venture
They'd then exchange chatters love's vows
On desk racks tube she found
Up hung a sketch about green pines
Mist's hues wind's tints seemed fine
Subtle strokes came to life when viewed
He spoke This I just drew
Few words for worth please do grant it
Fey hand moved like storm's blitz
On spare space twas a writ quatrain
Flair spills pearls he'd exclaim
Dames Ban's Xie's verses came second
Lifetimes of abstinence
I must've lived to have won fine prize
She spoke Your form I've spied
Either rich or inside Gold Gates
As bleak as is my fate
Has Fate bound us How may we know
Childhood's years I recall
A seer who'd foretold future
Those whose skills charms emerge
Through eras they've been hurt tortured
Look at you I wonder
Can polar fates ever join not
He said By fate tie's wrought
'Gainst Heaven's will man's fought some won
Should our knot come undone
This frame shall face weapons demise
They'd bring all thoughts to light
Trade wine's cups as love thrived inner
Merry day seemed shorter
West hills had long covered sunrays
No longer could she stay
She left her feet moved straight homebound
Once there some news she found
Her parents were still out feasting
Gate draped by silk veiling
Through the dark yard she'd spring swiftly
On boughs Moon shone dimly
Lamp flickered midst study's shut blinds
He'd barely closed his eyes
Half-asleep at desk's side nodding
Footsteps broke his dreaming
Though late she was coming closer
He'd been dreaming of her
Once roused awed by flower in sight
She spoke I've on this night
For beau risked striding right toward here
Though we're now staying near
Who knows if it's a mere vision
He'd greet her jubilant
Fill incense vase lengthen tapers
They'd write oaths on papers
Smooth hair lock knife severed in two
Midst sky glowed Moon's bright hue
Two mouths at once swore to one vow
Thorough advice came out
On bones troth was carved now - always
Cups of fine wine they'd trade
Silk sash spread scents her shade glass caught
Air's cool Moon's clear he'd talk
In me burns one long-sought ardor
Proper rite's yet occurred
Too soon is blunt desire no
She spoke Red thread joins souls
By oath our hearts are known fully
Except for birds for bees
Other requests shall see no nay
Famed for your lute he'd say
Like Zhong Qi for your plays I've longed
It's not great she'd respond
Since you have asked some songs I'll play
Moon-lute at back porch stayed
Which Kim raised brow-high hastily
My skill's humble said she
Why'd you notice make me bothered
Big and small strings fingered
Four strings were tuned to perfection
Played Han-Chu Contention
Clashes of bronze iron soared high
Sima's Phoenix Seeks Bride
Rang dolefully like cries of pains
Li Kang's Guang Ling tunes came
Like streams forth moving same with clouds
Cross-border Wang Qiang's sounds
Thoughts of Lord of home bound her will
Clear notes like egret's trills
Deep tones like fall's half-stilled echoes
Breeze-like adagios
With fast-paced allegros like hail
At times flames flared grew stale
Sheer joy deep grief he felt in turns
Knees drawn head bowed ears yearned
Brows joined while innards churned tangled
He'd begin Such marvel
Therein agony's shown plainly
Played tunes are dark gloomy
Pain your own heart aggrieve others
Habit's set she answered
Happy or sad Nature decrees
Valued words I'll concede
May dark moods be appeased lowered
Scents spread from bloomed flower
Glances conveyed eager passion
Lust's waves upset reason
Loving acts showed wanton intents
Tis no game she'd dissent
Desist and listen then to me
Young peach's with scant beauty
Peach field dares not impede bluebird
A wife's role I've entered
Stay chaste I must to serve my groom
In drupe copse near Pu loom
Impure women for whom none crave
If this is done in haste
Lifelong chasteness I'll waste this night
Of all love tales of times
No dyad could be like Cui-Zhang
Rains clouds smashed stone bronze rang
Overzealous thirst sprang then ceased
They lived intimately
Yet inner scorns had squeezed both hearts
At West roof they'd depart
Love ceased in shame sweet start turned naught
If no resistance's wrought
Who shall bear the shame brought later
Why soon rush shy flower
Alive I'll remember owed due
To him reason broke through
His love respect then grew tenfold
Pale shades outside weakened
From main gate came urgent calling
To her chamber she'd spring
Kim crossed peach yard leaving quickly
With door unlocked he'd see
A boy servant carry letters
Kim's uncle'd expired
To home they must transfer remains
To Liao Yang's far domain
He must join the cortege out there
Father's words made him scared
To her he'd rush to bare trouble
He'd recite all words told
He'd for the funeral leave her
We've yet exchanged all words
True union was never fulfilled
Moon our witness shines still
Though far apart hearts will stay twined
For three years on far miles
Long shall knot stay untied  O woe
Shield yourself like gems gold
So I afar may know some peace
She harked with heart heavy
And then hesitantly answered
Troublesome Thread Elder
Conjoined we're yet severed we're now
By sacred oaths we're bound
Hair may turn gray love vowed shan't wilt
For months years I'll wait still
My far-flung man I will grieve for
We've pledged our hearts' accord
For life lute won't board foreign boat
Long shall hills stand streams float
Return to whom you've coaxed this day
Joined hands would not part way
Bright sun past roof had stayed upright
Slowly he'd leave steps slight
Tears flowed once his goodbye was weaved
Colt reined bags heaved swiftly
Woes were split each step cleaved joined route
Strange scenes mournful soul found
Sparse swifts afar rails' howls from trees
He - midst rains winds - was grieved
His lovesickness increased each day
At West porch she remained
Mixed feelings snarled like skeins of threads
She'd view skyline ahead
Willows withered blooms' fresh hues died
Back in thoughts plagued her mind
Her clan from party's site was there
Greetings they'd not yet shared
The yamen's bailiffs snared the house
Armed with swords cubs throughout
The hellish beasts stomped round fiercely
Father son their cangues seized
One merciless rope leashed two lives
They buzzed round like blow flies
Destroyed baskets and wiped out looms
They stole gems clothes heirlooms
And filled their greed bag's womb wholly
Who'd bound them with misdeed
This felony who'd weaved like so
They asked and came to know
A silk merchant had called for them
Frightened kinsmen grew numb
Protests shook earth wrongs summed dimmed clouds
All day they'd beg and bow
Deaf ears heard naught straight down flew hands
Hung heels tied by wronged strand
Hard rocks would break no chance for flesh
Horrors on faces etched
Could Heaven help Far-fetched it seemed
Twas bailiffs' old routine
To gain money they'd scheme torture
To save poor kin of hers
In changed time she'd observe changes
Destined love folks' merits
Of love and duty which weighed more
Twas troth which she'd ignore
Duty must be before all else
With mind made up she'd yell
For my father I'll sell my life
There was old Chung  a scribe
The old servant was kind at heart
He saw her faith impart'd
Pity for her would start in him
Briberies were his scheme
Three-hundred tael was deemed needed
They were house-arrested
In three days she'd submit owed pay
Poor young child cursed by fate
Woes like sudden storm raged over
From all she'd be severed
How'd she mourn love when her self's spurned
Raindrop cared not woes earned
She'd risk her life return merits
Matchmakers heard her wish
To all corners news whisked swiftly
One hag from their county
One far-hailed suitor she brought in
Scholar Mã he'd begin
Hometown's in nearby Lin Qing land
Past forty was this man
With clean-shaved mug and handsome duds
Master aids were raucous
Upstairs he'd head as ushered so
High seat he smugly stole
The matchmaker then called out Kiều
Her grief her kin's she'd feel
With each step made tears spilled in flows
Shy bloom feared mists and squalls
Ashamed at her shadow bold-faced
Hands hair hag forced down traced
Sad as aster as wast'd plum's limb
Charms skills he'd gauge and deem
Force lute give fan and theme test rhymes
The guest was gratified
He'd probe to improvise his deals
Here to buy gem he spilled
Wedding gifts how much will they be
Worth thousand gold is she
Hag spoke They're desp'rate please show grace
Bargains  back forth  they'd state
Four hundred tael was placed lastly
Deal sealed things sailed smoothly
Birthday's cards would then be viewed swopped
Espousal's date adopt'd
With cash in hands woes stopped at once
With old Chung's assistance
Old Vương was thus pardoned for now
Their sight brought grief profound
Old guts shrank tears bled out much pained
I've wished you would have gained
A worthy match obtained fine spouse
Such woes Heaven's cast down
Who's framed us made our house severed
Axe old frame could weather
Yet wronged child's pains foster more pains
Soon or late life must end
I'd rather die now than suffer
Words made tears flow harder
On lime wall he'd hammer his skull
They fast stopped his impulse
Softly his daughter lulled his grief
Worthless is youth I keep
If duty's not a whit repaid
Can't like Ying beg for grace
But like Li I shall trade my life
Tree grows old as time flies
Yet countless boughs are by it raised
If your love for me stays
Rainstorms will likely slay us all
Rather alone I fall
Bloom drops while tree stands tall leafy
I'll heed what Fate decrees
Think me a sprout relieved while green
Let no rash thought set in
Yourself you'll hurt your clan you'll raze
Ears heeded sense conveyed
They stared while tears cascaded down
Outside Mã just came round
He signed their pact allowed them gold
Thread Elder's callous cold
Blindly ties threads follows no frame
In hands once cash was claimed
Black white swapped hearts grew tamed quickly
Chung helped much as could be
With gifts offered so ceased charges
The clan's trouble halted
Wedding's time was prompted posthaste
Alone by lamp she stayed
Grief snarled her hair tears sprayed soaked gown
Come what may still I'm bound
Bound and pained by the vow we've sworn
Through much for love he's yearned
But loving me has earned him naught
Dried up oath's cups have not
Yet I've wronged him this troth's effaced
In Liao Yang faraway
How'd he think I've betrayed his faith
Though countless vows were placed
Tis the end of this fate surely
Next life should bond not cease
Reborn horse ox shall see to debts
Until love's due's offset
In Diyu I'll forget never
Her private thoughts wandered
Tears drenched kerchief saucer's oil dried
From deep sleep Vân would rise
By lamp she sat and tried soothing
Heaven's caprice's startling
Alone you're shouldering our woe
It's late why sit in throes
Private affair tangles your heart
Heart's brimmed with pains she'd start
Tangled love's thread still marks my soul
Ashamed to have it known
But keeping this would show treason
My request please hearken
One bow I'll give reason I'll state
My love's yoke snaps halfway
Mend severed thread I pray you will
Kim and I met for real
Shared day's fans night's cups sealed love's oaths
Then came sudden storm's growth
Duty troth can't be both fulfilled
Your own Springtime's long still
Pity your blood please fill my vows
Though flesh rots bones break down
I'll smile in death allowed good name
Gold hairpin sheet of claim
Guard these items the same with troth
Should married life unfold
Remember me whom woes cumbered
I'm gone vow's gifts linger
Shared oath's incense with the Moon lute
One far day if you should
Burn incense pot fine tune these strings
Ôi Kim lang Hỡi Kim lang
Outside see leaves rustling
Feel faint breezes passing  That's me
My soul bears troth heavy
Even in death I'll see to dues
From earth far from Diyu
With cleansing drops please do bless me
Pin's snapped glass's smashed wholly
Love's thoughts can't be fully conveyed
Thousand bows for my mate
Short red string broke away quickly
My fate's like lime pasty
Strong waves will sweep posy away
O Kim O Kim My mate
From now I'll have betrayed your trust
She then fell unconscious
Breaths stilled hands were gelid as brass
Parents' deep sleep was smashed
In out servants amassed about
Herbs cure were brought around
Fresh tears flowed though faint's bout just passed
What happened Old Vương asked
Kiều kept sobbing aghast speechless
In father's ears Vân hissed
From hairpin oath's sheet this begins
Vương Your lost love's my sin
Now this failed pledge your kin will bear
Whose fault split destined pair
As duckweed cloud you'll fare straying
Your will about I'll bring
Long time may pass ruling will stay
She'd bow and softly say
Father my debt please pay squarely
I mind not fate paltry
Fear not my bones buried far-flung
Countless sorrows they'd sung
South tower's drum had rung pressing
Sudden coach came waiting
Sudden flutes lutes urging goodbyes
She'd leave loved ones behind
Tears soaked through rocks heart's skeins severed
Dark clouds atop gathered
Grass wilted down under dew dropped
At lodge bridal coach stopped
Four besieging walls locked her in
She felt shamed toward hair mien
For her fate she'd begin laments
Sky's gem's in scoundrel's hands
From shine and hail in vain guarded
Stray fate had I noted
Peach stamen I'd have split for Kim
By me East Wind was screened
His failed wish here ails him afar
Rejoin should path of ours
What hope's left for a marred body
Born into vagrancy
Pointless is my beauty this life
On table laid a knife
In kerchief's fold it'd lie covered
When feet meet high water
This knife shall deliver my fate
Fall's night idled away
Alone half-roused she stayed distraught
That Mã was she'd known naught
A seasoned rake who sought curt games
Bad luck in gambling came
He'd seek fresh fund midst realms bawdy
In one brothel reigned she
Dame Tú  an elderly harlot
A chance meeting Fate brought
They were alike both fraught with lies
Joined fund built store lived by
Whole year they'd sell scents dyes smoothly
Across markets countries
Bought girls as maids who'd be debased
Fortune Heaven dictates
For hapless soul ill fate was spun
Poor girl with elegance
A bloom bought to merchant's canoe
Their scam she'd got into
With cheap gifts impromptu rite's date
Flag now in his hand stayed
Gem-like grace made heart sway harder
Astral scent Earth's treasure
Thousands of gold deserves her smile
To first claim bloom worthwhile
Nobles rich folks shall vie for turn
Three hundred tael it'll earn
Square spent cash then return profit
Before mouth lied tidbits
Spent gold he missed Sky's gift he craved
Low hand Heaven's peach lades
I'll pluck it satiate life's glees
On this earth how many
Men know how pure those pleasing lusts
Wholeness I'll readjust
With pom'granate's juice blood from combs
I'll fool those common folks
They'll pay the same as normal  So
Should old hag complain though
On-knee session I'll throw for her
On these remote corners
That I do naught shall stir queries
Camellia  Pity
Was defiled by the bee's entrance
Wild storm wrought disturbance
Cared neither gem fragrance nor spice
Vague was that nuptial night
By wedding lamp she lied ignored
Private teardrops outpoured
Disdained oneself deplored one's guest
He's but a filthy pest
Women's name my prized flesh's sullied
What hope is left for me
My life's accordingly finished
Rued love scorned fate blended
Knife drawn she'd relinquish her life
But then she stopped revised
I'm fine with death are my parents
Were there a consequence
They'd bear repercussions for me
Woes will with time decrease
Soon or late death shall seize my life
She thought hard of her plights
Through walls rang cocks' loud cries booming
Lookout's horns hailed morning
Mã urged her We're leaving promptly
Heart-wrenching split there'd be
Colts' hooves hobbled bumpy wheels rolled
After ten miles on road
Vương's sendoff fest followed after
Outside host guests gathered
While mother child conferred inside
They stared tears bled like tides
In mother's ears confided Kiều
Born a girl  shame I feel
My debts to you when will I pay
Like soiled pond dust lustrat'd
Lifelong feelings I'll place with thee
His antics I did see
Tricked by a skilled phony I fear
At lodge he'd not stay near
Enter warily veer swiftly
Of words he'd speak crudely
He'd lord with flippancy toward mate
It seems he's not so straight
This one's a  I daresay - peddler
What have I left mother
In distant soils interred for sure
Dame Vương heard words outpoured
Wished to split Heaven pour outcries
Farewell wine's cups yet dried
Outside Mã pressed for flight early
Heart fraught with empathy
Fore colts Vương fervently begged bowed
Green-peach willow-frail spouse
Through home's mishap she's now taken
At far skies horizons
She'll brave rains shines burdens alone
May grand pine's shades be loaned
So vine's from snows mists shown shelter
Words ceased Mã then answered
Red string's bound I'm to her fastened
From here on what'll happen
Sun Moon witness demons' blades slay
Coach left at tempest's pace
As though flying toward place beyond
Wet eyes sought carriage gone
At far horizon spawned they'd peer
Midst strange soils Kiều was now
Frosts bleached the bridge dark clouds dimmed roads
In cold gales reeds huddled
Fall's sky's sorrows were all on her
Dark night's routes mists covered
She'd view the Moon rue the shared vows
On fall's leaves reds endowed
Birds' cries like folks' profound feelings
Through strange streams hills crossing
Month passed they'd arrive in Lin Zi
At gates her carriage ceased
One from back drapery emerged
Pale skin she first observed
Soaring bulging was her physique
Brazen greetings she'd speak
As told Kiều trekked - steps meek - inside
Charming dames stood in lines
Four five patrons sat nigh loitered
Mid-house stood grand altar
With one white-browed figure's image
Twas brothels' old practice
Trade-founder's heritage they prized
Brought incense sticks blooms by to pray
To him luckless dames cried for grace
Undraped fore him she'd stay
Light up incense then pray softly
Neath mat placed blessed posy
Toward her approached birds bees ample
Kiều was in awe puzzled
As told she bowed as old hag prayed
May fortune bless our trade
Nights be Hanshi while days Yuan Xiao
May countless guests come round
Parrots nightingales crowd their mates
Countless letters be placed
Front doors send off back gates welcome
Strange words hit her eardrums
Such shady notions drummed her mind
Thus concluded the rite
Dame Tú cross-legged sat high on bed
Bow to your Mum she said
To Dad there bow your head as well
Kiều Vagrancy befell
His mistress I'm impelled to be
Of my role I'm naïve
Parrots nightingales ye swapped - Why
Wedding's gifts he brought by
With him I've lived and lied till now
Why're our ranks upside down
Please explain so my doubt's conquered
Her words Tú registered
Fit of hellish anger she'd throw
Hey Hey Now this I know
From me this burglar stole my mate
'I'll seek a girl' he says
Have her serve to create profit
Curse your unfaithfulness
Itchy to first test this cargo
Silk's worth's been washed dissolved
Gone Gone My cash will flow to naught
This wench here I have bought
My house's rules you'll be taught to heed
When that swine bared his greed
Why not slap him why ceded so
Docilely you followed
You're green yet itched to show lust thirst
My rules shan't be traversed
Leather knout Tú grabbed headfirst charged in
High Sky thick Earth herein
I'm long dead cried Kiều since leaving
I have naught left to cling
She searched her sleeve baring dagger
Tú feared her last wager
As Tú still stared downward went blade
Fair grace fine wits were frayed
One vicious thrust to slay life's thread
News of her wrong far spread
Like sedges folks congest'd inside
In death-like sleep Kiều lied
Tú was trembling meanwhile listless
To west wing she'd insist
Doctors be brought enlist porters
Kiều's life was yet severed
One dame appeared by her in dreams
Hissed Karma's yet redeemed
From ill fate you can't scheme to flee
Bleak woman's fate's yet ceased
Man can't change Fate's decree at will
Your fate you must fulfill
In Qian Tang River we'll gather
Whole day she'd been doctored
Kiều woke from deep stupor slowly
Nearby Dame Tú she'd see
She'd soothe so woes would cease for her
Life is lived once my girl
Spring bud's sprouting further it'll grow
Toward you errors were showed
Wrongly I've forced a golden flint
Here already you're in
Stay in sanctum waiting for spouse
Alive your worth's still sound
Find worthy match from house proper
One wrong's worth not rancor
You hurt yourself others as well
By ears rang pleas heartfelt
Sound sense seemed to dispel worries
Recalled dream's prophecy
Karma Heaven had preordained
This life's debts had yet waned
Next life would she obtain fresh dues
Kiều listened thought things through
Politely spoke None do wish this
If it's true such is bliss
Yet later on will it be so
Here swarm bees birds ample
I'd rather die than fall depraved
Hag said Put doubts away
Words told from heart shall stay thus true
Should I later fail you
Heaven observes refutes that lie
Firm claims were vowed with might
Kiều's distress thus grew light lighter
Secured in Jade Tower
Far hills nigh Moon were her few friends
Four sides space stretched immense
With gold sand dunes dirt trends dyed red
Fore clouds night's lamp grieves bled
Thoughts and scenes made heart shredd'd in two
Moon-witnessed cups  she rued
Missed he who'd seek her news in vain
Midst far skies seas immense
Could ardent heart be cleansed cleanly
Rued folks who'd wait firmly
Who'd warm their beds who'd repel heat
Home's yard light raved rains beat
Could decandra's trunk fit embrace
She'd view dusk's port away
Whose distant boat still waved its sails
On river's mouth eyes fell
Stray blooms were washed by swells toward where
She'd view parched grassland there
Merged horizon earth shared blue hue
View cove on which gales blew
Roaring sea waves ensued round her
Midst foreign hills waters
Pains of exile authored quatrains
Sadly Kiều dropped gemmed blind
Through wall echoed replying rhyme
Twas one in his youth's prime
Fine countenance refined vestments
She thought him a student
Sở Khanh was name given to her
On veils Moon's shade fluttered
He too seemed enamored by sight
What fragrance grace divine
What woe has led your kind toward here
Your worth's not of man's sphere
Why'd proud flower you smear your name
Curse old Heaven  for shame
This wrath who feels the same with me
Hero's heart should beaut see
He'll promptly set you free from binds
Fall's sills had closed outside
Firm claims within her mind echoed
She thought of him self's woes
Touched by kindness bestowed to stray
Shines rains had passed away
How long would woeful fate haunt her
She'd risk sending letter
Asking kind hands offered for aid
All pains her note conveyed
Of her exile repaid home's woes
Soon as dawn's mists dissolved
She had messenger go to him
Gold west sun idly dimmed
Reply then arrived in her hands
On flowered note he'd sent
Two words - Tích Việt  were grandly scribed
Deftly she analyzed
The twenty first Canine's hour
To woods late birds fast hurled
Camellia covered half-Moon
East wall trees' shades were strewn
Through tipped sills Sở Khanh soon entered
Though shy she still ventured
To bow softly tenderly say
Like foams and weeds I'm swayed
Like a lost bird I've strayed toward here
I beg your aid sincere
This favor I'll revere for life
He harked nodded replied
I'm not one who desires debts
Me you've ever met
Lust's seas I'll squarely set  I've vowed
Kiều I'm indebted now
What method have you found please guide
Khanh I have wind-swift rides
Tough underlings outside also
Let's seize this chance and go
Of thirty-six schemes know what's best
Storms may rave rains may press
With me none shall suppress your leave
Proud words birthed disbelief
Twas too late so she'd leap onward
Blindly feet slid forward
Resigned to what Fate stored for her
Downstairs they'd both slither
Rife steeds - ahead after - made haste
Fall's night languished away
Aft hills Moon hid gales swayed leaves fell
Mist bleached grass' tint on trail
Homebound feelings would swell each pace
Cocks crowed  fast seriate
Loud shouts of men fast chased after
Scared golden heart quivered
Elsewhere Sở Khanh ushered his ride
Alone fears drowned her mind
Woods' trail dropped low soared high scared her
Ruthless is Creator
Why crumpled ailed flower like so
A mob poured in enclosed
Helpless she was constrained wholly
Dame Tú rushed there straightly
Dragged her back angrily den-bound
Without questioning bout
She trampled bloom without mercy
Flesh bones were all earthly
Kiều ached flesh split harshly blood dropped
She'd confess beg to stop
Battered back arched blood-daubed head bowed
To woman's fate I'm bound
Away from home I'm now severed
My life you reign over
Hence I'll take whatever you will
For myself naught I feel
Yet won't my demise kill assets
Eels mind not mudded heads
My chasteness shall be shed hereon
Her words Dame Tú pounced on
Confession signed - a bond was sealed
Her bailsman was Mã Kiều
Pained by her harsh ordeals offered
Hag kept reproaching her
Till long long last conferred mercy
To back Kiều was carried
Mã Kiều then discreetly conveyed
To deceit you fell prey
All here of Sở Khanh's nature know
Famed cheater of brothels
His hand's killed rosemallows' branches
Foul play was concocted
By the well-known psychic - witch pair
Thirty taels was his fare
'Twas no fluke  this affair's preplanned
He coaxed then off he ran
Beg wisely or you shan't be safe
Kiều spoke His vows were grave
Yet within he's a knave so vile
While she still strained her mind
One brazen mug inside appeared
Sở Khanh spoke up in jeer
Heard there's one wench right here somewhere
Accused I had her snared
This face of mine you there you know
Kiều spoke All thing's settled
Nothing happened it's so  nothing
Sở Khanh thundered booming
Strode in raised hand smacking frail soul
Heaven knows she'd bellow
Who seduced whom who sold whom out
Pushed me in well profound
Who vowed then swallowed vow promptly
Tích Việt note I received
Your face's certain to me to all
Straight claims spread fast through halls
They'd jeer and mock his fraud his spite
Treason was brought to light
Busted he'd opt to hightail then
Alone with her sorrows
She mourned deeply for woeful self
Pure like silver snow's veil
Suffer all must herself the same
Life's filled with joys and shames
One's beauty can't remain constant
My past life's indecent
I must make amendments this life
Vase's long been fragmentized
I'll square life's debts with my body
One clear-Moon night she'd see
Dame Tú drop by slowly advise
Efforts this trade requires
All hostesses must strive to learn
Kiều said Rains come gusts turn
This risk I cannot spurn or split
If all's alike hag spit
Who will waste cash to sit in here
There're wonders in our sphere
Night's guests day's mates cashier or take
Seven looks to partake
And eight techniques to make guests pleased
Play till guests grow fatigued
Make stones fall hard minds cease to think
At times frown at times wink
To chant Moon's verse to sing with blooms
Those crafts our trade subsumes
Master them all round-groomed you'll be
Kiều harked brows seemed to squeeze
Turned crescent-shaped face became pale
Such words made Kiều turn ailed
Heartless odd things assailed man's life
Poor girl born dignified
Must now learn mystifying trades
Shameless she'd be one day
What else was left of fate of hers
Poor soul from home severed
Trapped in hands of strangers was she
Brothel dropped rose drap'ries
Higher gem's worth worthier prize
In swarmed bees butterflies
They'd dine and laugh through nights months round
Leaves hailed winds twigs hailed fowls
Dawn sent Song Yu dusk found Zhang Qing
Sober once came mornings
Startled she woke ruing her life
Raised in silks draped in blinds
Yet now a crushed bloom by the trail
Face - winds beat mists set - swelled
Frame - bees butterflies felt wholly
Though bedmates were many
To her love was empty unreal
Blooms winds she'd oft watch feel
Four sides Moon lit snow filled past shrouds
All scenes were in glooms drowned
When man grieved scenes were bound to grieve
Sketch and verse she'd oft weave
By blooms play chess strings tweaked fore Moon
Forced joys would end too soon
Friendless she was in tune with none
Ignored blooms soaked leaves spun
Mused hundred thoughts silently slaved
Fragmented thoughts roamed stray
Feelings tangled pains laced throughout
Missed nine labors profound
Mulberries hid sundown each day
Thousands of miles away
Parents knew not ill fate of hers
Naïve brother sister
Who'd take her place to serve them now
Mourned transcendental vows
Had he yet heard about her plights
Zhang Tai willow he'd find
Yet young sprig was plucked by strangers
His love her kin answered
Had tree joined with flower thus far
Her heart's skein tangled snarled
Dreamed of homeland afar at night
Alone midst foreign skies
Round went sunsets arrived set suns
Moon's Hare fled Sun's Crow spun
Pity the poor soul shunned by Fate
Those born with Heaven's grace
In turn were cursed to face ruin
Doomed to fates of dusts winds
Disgraced once first to win mercy
One man midst tourists came
Twas Scholar Thúc first name Kỳ Tâm
Wu Xi Chang Zhou he's from
For father's shop he'd come to stay
Intrigued with Kiều's crowned grace
His rose card found its way toward her
Through veil faced peach flower
All traits were mesmerizing
Like young quince's sprig thriving
Charms bloomed further midst Spring's winds rains
Moon viewed bloom ardor reigned
Midst Spring's night who could rein one's heart
Their souls linked hence they'd start
Knot was tied who could part them now
Dawns till dusks two were bound
From bedmates to propounding troth
For them pure luck was wrought
Thúc's father must head toward hometown
Drowned in passion profound
Through Spring he'd oft come round to Kiều
Moon they'd view winds they'd feel
Gods' wine filled cups rhymes spieled jointly
They'd taste dawn's scents noon's tea
Go's board deemed moves lutes weaved joined tunes
Lost in pleasures' pursuits
Concord strengthened love soon deepened
How one glance moves nations
Leaves all buildings shaken with ease
Thúc spending as he pleased
Would spend thousands to seize one mirth
Money's scents made greed surge
Dame Tú groomed Kiều's grace worth further
Night cuckoos hailed summer
Rife pomegranate's flowers laced walls
On slow days in her hall
She'd drop rose veil and draw spiced baths
Such pure-white skin she had
Nature'd forged a fine masterpiece
All curves arches he'd see
He'd praise feelings forth weaved Tang rhymes
Kiều said You've bared your mind
Your words are gems your lines brocades
Toward home my thoughts have strayed
Your verse I'd humbly pay tribute
Yet midst Hang's clouds heart broods
Your verse's reply I would owe thee
Such strange words uttered he
Young branch's not of old tree's making
Fall-wave eyes dimmed wilting
Her face showed heartrending despair
I'm like torn bloom midst air
You're butterfly that cares for games
You're married thus you're claimed
Save your breath for day wanes quickly
Since we first met said he
Always my heart's carried firm vows
Till old age we'll be bound
Hence I'll seek out profound stream's source
Countless thanks she'd discourse
Yet fallouts shall be brought on all
Your Ping Kang stay you've stalled
For flower's guise you've fallen hard
Then when scent's lost guise's marred
Will that love stay untarnished so
At cinnamon threshold
Of Moon's palace Chang-o presides
Accord's knot was long tied
One extra will divide your troth
Don't for clouds weeds which float
Make love's depths ebb and flow for thee
Hundred grieves due to me
Once I'm dead who'll then be decried
If you're a man with might
Protect me from all plights you can't
But if your power's scant
Lion's jaws shall dismantle me
Dropped at your wife's mercy
Envy will like flames threefold rage
Above your father's placed
Down at me will his grace be showed
Or scorn wall-stemmed willows
From brothel to brothel return
Soiled names we will then earn
Mine's fine but I'm concerned for yours
Find answers - I implore
Me if you do adore then yes
Thúc said You purely guess
Are my feelings as yet unclear
Leave all to me don't fear
Unlike Wu-Laos you're here with me
Entwined always you'll see
Swords stones shan't part storms we shall brave
Thorough questions they'd trade
By hills seas vows would stay true strong
Night waned yet talks grew long
Moon's Hare had hid among west hills
A jaunt was his excuse
To safe house Thúc took Kiều to hide
War scheme peace plot devised
Sought lawmen's help had spies stake out
To Dame Tú news came round
Defeated she was bound to cede
Ransom Thúc would bequeath
To court redemption deed he'd show
All matters were settled
Fairy was from mortal's dirt free
Man and wife joined to be
Love grew like stream long sea profound
Love's incense flames spread out
Pearl's sheen lotus' hue proudly shone
Six intimate months flew
Wutong yard's green boughs fused with gold
Fall's mist-white buds bloomed glowed
Thúc's father to his home returned
Like storms thunders wrath burned
He'd split them up concerns laced heart
One harsh rebuke he'd start
Order her to depart toward den
Fore strict lecture Thúc then
Took risk used heart to wane his rage
I know my sins he'd state
Thunders axes I'll face gladly
Yet hand's been dyed dirtied
How can my mistakes be undone
Whole day I'm her husband
Once married who would sunder tie
If father so decides
Shame of a froward child I'll brave
Steel will could not be swayed
Mad he'd kneel fore court's gates to try
Flat grounds were quaked by tides
Red warrant was sent by the court
They'd follow their escorts
Side-by-side kneel before court's yard
View one steel face like char
Of the judge who'd impart harsh cries
That man's led a base life
And that woman's a lying fraud
That wasted scent bloom gnawed
Used make-ups to enthrall a fool
Based on complaint I rule
In all outcomes you'll fuel troubles
Based on the law I'll show
Two solutions  Your call to make
The law's sanction you'll take
Or at brothel retake your place
My mind's been made she'd say
Spider midst webs shan't stay longer
I'm his wife pure or blurred
Though frail and green thunders I'll face
By law punish he'd state
Lone peony was caged in woods
Resigned she stilled withstood
Rose cheeks grew pale brows would grimace
She lied midst yard dust-laced
Face - blurred mirror form - wasted bloom
Pity for Thúc - his gloom
Afar he watched consumed by pains
For me you're wronged in vain
If only I'd back then complied
Shallow in heart and mind
For whom fore moon and vines you're shamed
The judge heard cries exclaimed
Touched to Thúc he then came to probe
Tear-drenched Thúc promptly told
In full when he'd proposed to her
Near far she's considered
From the start she's augured ill fate
I've caused her current state
Because her trust was placed in me
The judge felt empathy
He'd drop sternness conceive a way
If it's true what you say
This harlot knows what's base what's right
Thúc said Through drifting life
She's humbly learned to write po'try
The judge then laughed Really
Your theme's The Cangue show me your flair
She'd heed brush raised on air
Her work was brought to where he sat
Prime-Tang's best this surpassed
Thousand gold taels can't match flair grace
Skilled beau  beauty I say
No Zhou-Chen couples may outshine
Bear not hate ire in mind
Thwart not concert divine midway
To court you've brought your case
Outside's lawsuit love's placed within
A wife your son's brought in
Banish dissents therein  all's fine
Ordered wedding forthright
Bridal coach dashed flames twined with stars
Two lines of drums flutes marched
For peach shrouds they'd depart with haste
Her virtues skills he'd praise
Sir Thúc's ill will and hate thus ceased
Scents of orchids lilies
Filled home where hate once weaved discord
Across dawn's wine noon's tea
Plums' hues waned lotus' leaves just grew
One still night in shared room
Fears for shared marriage bloomed  she'd say
Since frail willow came stayed
Swifts geese have oft switched place year's passed
Home's news you've scarcely had
For mistress you've looked past your wife
Worries in me stirred strife
This news for us who'll hide from her
Of her I've caught rumors
Adheres to codes speaks words fearsome
I fear her depths awesome
Like seabed stream's bottom they are
One year has passed thus far
That we can't hide this farther's sure
Till now no news's procured
Or something's wrong in your household
Back to home you should go
To please her first then know her mind
From dawns to dusks we hide
You put this off our life's undone
He'd heed her sound reasons
He'd with resolve hardened return
At dawn Thúc's father learned
Of this intent and urged him too
One farewell cup was brewed
From home he'd fast head to far land
Bluish Qin river spanned
Sparse willows' limbs draped Yang Guan's trail
Hands joined they sighed hearts fell
Parting's cups stilled words failed smothered
Kiều said Hills streams sever
Inner peace's wrought outer peace's earned
Yếm pin can be discerned
Blindfolded we catch birds in vain
This marriage we've attained
Once home please do explain clearly
In case wild storms stir seas
To her rules I'll gladly abide
It's better than to hide
Which will bring forth great plights later
Love me please remember
Through one long year ever I'll wait
Parting's cups mourn this day
Welcoming cups we'll trade next year
He'd mount his steed and steer
Fall-dyed maple woods smeared far hills
After him red dust filled
Midst green mulberries Kiều lost sight
She'd spend her lonesome nights
Through thousand miles he'd ride alone
In halves the Moon who'd torn
Half lit lone bed half shone long roads
Speak not of thoughts on road
But of thoughts first wife showed inside
Of honored Hoạn's birthright
Hoạn Thư  Minister's child renown
Fortunate love he found
They'd had hair plait'd threads bound for years
Well-mannered she appeared
Reasoning skills were fearsome wise
His new bloom she'd descried
From all but him same tidings came
She failed to quell heart's flames
For obscene acts she blamed her spouse
To me had he avowed
That lesser girl I'd now condone
I'd save good name I've sown
For stains of envy won't serve me
Yet this he hid buried
Made childish comedy absurd
Though far of this I've heard
For your fraud I've conjured a plan
Fret not she's but an ant
Within the bowl it can't crawl free
Their eye contacts I'll cease
Force her head down so she can't rise
I'll act before their eyes
He sought planks sold boat I'll show him
She kept her thoughts within
Ignored rumors stray winds carried
Next week two men she'd see
They'd brought news to achieve favors
She'd seethe with raw anger
You dare spin lies to perturb me
My man's unlike any
Some rumormongers weaved this lie
She fast displayed her might
Had one's teeth plucked one's vile mouth slapped
Secrets were tightly wrapped
Of rumors none dared blab one sound
Midst rosy walls she'd lounge
She'd talk laugh and walk round the same
Nights days heart's scorn inflamed
Back to rose hall Thúc came one night
Words of joy health they'd cry
Passion strengthened and brightly blazed
Dust-cleansing cups they'd trade
Yet their hearts' secrets stayed inside
He sought to learn her mind
His own affair he'd strive to say
She'd talk laugh drunken swayed
No slightest hints displayed she knew
Vase's mouth seems tightly glued
Why confess to her who won't ask
His inner qualms amassed
Would one tugged vine alas shake wood
Midst jokes laughter she would
Insert random inputs inside
Midst pearl-stone gold-brass twined
Your total trust and mine stay true
Praiseworthy are those who
Spread bee-butterfly rumors round
If I let guile confound
A laughingstock no doubt I'd be
She spoke with ease calmly
He'd heed her words parry her strike
They'd tease her make-up style
By shared lamp side-by-side view Moon
Home's bliss perch cress staled soon
On gold well wutong swooned sparsely
Sights of far lands he'd see
Miss farewell site miss seasons gone
Words of his thoughts yet formed
Of hers she had informed her mate
Whole year white cloud far stays
To Lin Zi you must pay visit
Guts' knots those words undid
He'd mount straight toward there flit promptly
Blue sky clear stream copied
Forts soared through mists sunny hills gleamed
Soon as horsewhip's noise screamed
For home her carriage steamed as well
All to mother she'd tell
Of dark treason bleak felled rapport
If to light envy's brought
It'll shame his name distort my own
I've feigned that I've not known
Yet my shrewd scheme's been sown readied
Land's route's one-month journey
Sea's route's straight to Lin Zi shorter
Clear the ship pick servers
Drag her back in fetter fore me
Have her weakened wearied
Hurt her shame her they'll see they'll jeer
Punish those of such sphere
Make a joke which for years shan't fade
Mother praised her fine play
Indulged her gave leeway to act
Sails ropes were set on deck
Hound Hawk picked out a pack of brutes
Her orders were minute
They'd sail down wind en-route for Qi
Lonesome by veiled window
Kiều's heart ached with sorrows varied
Sun's set on mulberries
Are they cold warm rightly cared for
Oath's clipped hair's grown once more
Do steel-etched vows I swore remain
Vine's meager fate's disdained
Will Heaven's laws maintain this troth
Through ups downs I've been brought
Should I've like Chang-o sought lone life
Through sills Fall's winds blew by
Half Moon three stars midst sky shimmered
Lit incense fore altar
Her prayer was then muttered halfway
Midst blooms brutes lied in wait
Their swift rise could dismay gods fiends
Yard was lit with blades' gleams
Kiều scared by what she'd seen grew numb
To sleep drug she'd succumb
Comatose she'd become shortly
On horse's saddle lied she
They'd set chamber study ablaze
By stream lied one corpse stray
To mislead it was placed inside
Servants were horrified
They'd dash for bushes hide midst trees
From close vicinity
Sir Thúc shocked saw the sea of flames
Master vassals fast came
They'd fight the flares exclaim for aid
By winds the flames were raised
For her they'd search yet they'd find none
They'd exchange stares look stunned
To well to bush they'd run blindly
In room where once lived she
One charred corpse midst debris they'd spot
Of fraud straight souls knew not
Twas her and no-one thought elseways
Sir Thúc's tears laced his face
Pitied lone son mourned graceful child
At home the corpse arrived
They'd wrap it up hold rites for her
Service was just over
Thúc arrived soon after on land
Her old chamber he scanned
Walls stood barren soot and chars piled
At mid-house he'd stop by
On altar stood inscribed tablet
Alas He'd cry upset
Pains burned entrails grief shredd'd his heart
His ceaseless sobs would start
To pure soul fate imparts wrong end
I thought we'd meet again
Not trade last words that send-off's day
To pains his grief gave way
None could soothe or allay his plights
He'd heard one mystic nigh
Could call spirits grasp high beings
Three Gods' Isles Nine Springs
From all realms he could bring back news
They'd offer him tributes
Have him seek her for clues queries
Before altar bowed he
Incense yet stopped he'd freed his soul
He came back clearly told
She's nowhere yet her story's learned
Much karma's debt she's earned
She's yet paid off her turn's yet come
To woes her sign succumbs
News shall come one year from present
You'll have your reunions
Yet no recognition is shown
Such queer wisdom he'd sown
Could they trust words intoned lightly
Twas but faux sorcery
In mortal realm why'd she remain
He'd mourn spring's bloom that'd waned
Could fair fairy again be met
Stream flowed bloom dropped  twas set
Or in mortal Hell yet confined
Hound Hawk pulled off foul plot
To their boat Kiều was brought held there
High sails strained cord strong airs
Wu Xi District was their planned stop
At manse's hall she was dropped
To the house Hound Hawk offered her
Locked up in maids' quarter
Lost still in deep slumber was she
She'd stir from sleep dreamy
Whose strange fort could she be inside
Half-lucid and surprised
Shouts for her presence nigh echoed
One maid urged her to go
Frightened she fast followed the maid
Saw huge forts long hallways
Lord Chancellor so said the sign
Bee-wax candles burned bright
On gem-etched bed sat High Lady
She'd ask detailed queries
Her tale Kiều candidly uttered
Came sudden rain thunder
Lazy licentious curs she'd cry
To sins this wench's inclined
She's fled from lords or lied to mates
Field's hen tomb's cat - this stray
All you are is a graceless lie
To me you've sold your life
And yet you still act high mighty
To my rod you shall see
Let thirty strokes teach thee lesson
Up down choired all servants
One hundred mouths couldn't save her
Bamboo staves hard battered
Flesh all tore up liver's grit quailed
Poor lone peach-plum branch ailed
Twas all shredded by hail and squall
Hua-nu she was then called
Assigned as chambers' thrall she'd be
Midst blue-gown maids toiled she
With skin charred hair snarly she'd brave
There lived one aged housemaid
For Kiều's charms grace she gave pity
She'd give her herbs and teas
Offer advice so she'd survive
Woe is you she'd advise
Willow-frail self should strive for peace
Your karma this must be
You've fallen for deceit I think
Walls have ears frames have chinks
Ignore others past links also
Should freak thunders rumble
Bees ants for justice howl in vain
Kiều's pearly tears down rained
Heart ached with private pains plenty
Fate of wind-dust ails me
This plight equals twice the old plights
Why too bleak fate of mine
Confines beauties to lives of woes
I reap what past life sowed
Blooms may wane pearls crumble I'll brave
Day in day out she slaved
For home's visit Young Lady came
She'd chat much with Madame
Who'd later call Kiều's name order
Young Lady needs servers
Go to her manse on her you'll wait
Kiều so humbly obeyed
Hell or Heaven which place she'd be
All day combs cloths readied
A slave to slave's duties was tied
Then came one tranquil night
Daily lute's craft was tried questioned
She'd heed lute's strings were strummed
Divine tunes made heart numb beguiled
Kiều's skills seemed to be prized
Harsh rules were somewhat lightened pared
She'd toil fore foreign stairs
Dusk groan with shades dawn bear heart's pains
Lin Zi's scant tie remained
Next life may oath again unite
Clouds dyed four sides pure white
Her far homeland where might it be
Days passed months went slowly
Of far-off status she knew naught
Since mandarin ducks fled
For months on his lone bed he'd lied
New Moon brought brows to mind
Left rouge scents multiplied his banes
Aster bloomed lotus waned
Winter Spring swapped yet pains lingered
Where was erstwhile lover
He'd blame fate to taper mourning
His moods birthed home's yearning
Homesickness urged guiding him there
Grand welcome Hoạn prepared
All news near far they'd share and trade
Chamber's blind was high raised
Kiều was called for obeisance's rite
Faltered steps trudged outside
Afar she'd recognized that face
Are eyes by sun lamp dazed
Thúc sits there at this place no doubt
All secrets now come out
Within a trap I'm bound surely
What scheme is this eerie
What mortal's this tricky this vile
She's turned husband and wife
Into master servile worker
Though talks smiles seem chipper
She kills without dagger inside
Now earth's low while sky's high
How should I act when nigh him now
His sight stirred fears profound
Like silkworm-spun threads bound in knots
Scared defy Kiều dared not
Her head bowed as she crossed the yard
Thúc's soul vanished off-guard
Alas It's Kiều he'd start Right here
How was she toward here steered
I've been deceived I fear by lies
He'd say naught seized by frights
Yet fail to stop pearl-like tears leaked
Lady would read him speak
Just home yet what grief streaks your mien
To mother's rites I've seen
Heart's climbed Qi peak pain's keen timeless
Hoạn praised What piety
Let wine ease all your grieves this day
Wine cups they'd swap and trade
While Kiều held gourds to sate orders
Hoạn eased her then rushed her
Made her kneel to offer him wine
Thúc grew more stupefied
He'd dry his cups entwined with tears
He'd turn laugh without cheer
Feign drunkenness to veer away
His wife cried sharply Maid
Make him drink up or face beating
Thúc felt his heart tearing
Drained proffered cups gulping tart tastes
Wine had yet dried she'd play new games
This maid's skills are vast quaint
Play one tune entertain Master
She grew numb in stupor
Fore screen tuned lute of hers meekly
Four strings moaned sobbed sharply
Caused feaster's heart to be shattered
One song her lute conjured
Outward one smiled inner one cried
Tears rained unchecked from eyes
He'd nod his head and wipe dews shed
At her Mistress roared threats
In cheers why strum distressing tunes
Have you no tact buffoon
You've caused my husband's gloom and pain
More anguish fueled Thúc's banes
Forced talks stiff smiles were feigned swiftly
Dragon clock showed Watch Three
Their faces seemed to please mistress
Within she relished this
Tonight's pleasure's dismissed aged blues
Thúc's guts shriveled askew
The more he thought more rues he'd know
Phoenix-room shared pillow
While lone Kiều faced lamp's glows all night
Now all had come to light
Envy's blood's bred queer life freakish
Made twain's eyes turn path split
Part mandarin kingfisher mates
Rift sky are far away
One bows down low one stays up high
Debt's grass-like yet lead-like
Once it's undone what tie still stays
Born to frail beauty's fate
Could I bear depths deep waves brutal
Late night thoughts burned echoed
Oil's plate waned while tears flowed all night
All day she'd serve the manse
Her face Young Lady scanned queried
She'd choose her words wisely
I feel for my privy sorrows
To Thúc Mistress would go
Dear please find out her woes for me
Thúc's entrails stung sharply
Neither view nor query felt right
Yet scared he'd harm her life
He'd risk asking to pry answers
Kneeling with head lowered
One confession paper she'd pen
Fore Mistress it was sent
She'd skim scant conscience then seemed stirred
To Thúc it was conferred
Let flairs be prized dolor be rued
Were her fate well-to-do
A gold manse her values would earn
On beauties life's tides turned
Grand skills yet in return ill fate
Such true words Thúc would say
Fine mien bleak fate  The way of life
All eras are alike
Hence ease your hands please find mercy
This said spoke Young Lady
She seeks Void's Gates to cease bleak fate
Fine Her wish I shall sate
From woe's cycle I'll aid her flight
My yard has Guan Yin Shrine
Hundred-foot figs all vines flowers
Hills pond stretch trees tower
There she'll tend there sutra she'll chant
Dawn cracked while light was scant
Five gifts scents blooms were granted bought
Fore altar Kiều was brought
Three Vows Five Nays cut off home's ties
Jia-sha replaced blue guise
Trạc Tuyền was her revised cult's name
Enough daily oil came
Two maids  Spring Fall  were named shrine's aids
Now midst blooms' field she'd stay
Close to Mauve Grove away from life
She'd not hope for love's ties
No more shamed rouge sufficed nicely
At shrine woes were buried
Days wrote sutras nights she lit scents
Drops from willow's branch cleansed
Heart's flames earthly intents away
Since she saw Buddha's way
Fall's Moon at times had stayed atop
Locked room was watched nonstop
She'd speak at meets yet sob alone
Shrine and study were close
Yet distant as tenfold streams hills
Thúc's sighs and groans were stilled
He'd do nothing until one day
For home Hoạn made her way
Thúc crossed the yard ran straight for Kiều
In tears pains were revealed
Blue collar's soaked with spilling tears
Bloom-keeper's fault's severe
Yet bloom's alone right here tortured
By woman's scheme conquered
Though pained for you utter I can't
Your woes from me began
Green Spring's lost pearl's by sand dirtied
I'd brave cascades gladly
I'd risk my life to be with you
But an heir's yet produced
I'll clench my teeth undo vowed troth
Shame I've stained bronze smashed stone
Hundred lives can't atone for sins
Kiều 'Round lone boat swirls spin
Float or sink it lies in fate's hand
Frail form squirms midst mud sand
Strange how till now I can survive
Raindrop falls where it might
Let people feast their eyes on this
A shame how lute strings fit
Troth lasts one day yet it's still troth
Please think have exit wrought
Deep love debt such act's fraught with both
Thúc Private thoughts I've sowed
Mortal hearts are unknowable
Should later come rains squalls
Both you and I shall all suffer
To flee you should venture
For you my love's severed from here
To different paths we're steered
When'll lost pledge be cohered again
Streams may dry rocks may wane
Silkworm till death still strains spins threads
Tales old new were expressed
They'd talk and talk incessantly
Eyes hands were locked tightly
Came sounds of maids' entry afar
With grief swallowed they'd part
Mistress split blooms apart entered
Sweetly she'd smile utter
From whence did you saunter my dear
Thúc From bloom viewing near
I came to watch nun here pen scripts
Such fine longhand she'd quip
Orchid Pavilion writs' equal
Stray fate's regrettable
Such skills a thousand gold's worthwhile
Temple's red tea they'd dry
To study heels aligned returned
Kiều grew more shamed concerned
To her maid she'd then turn whisper
Mistress came maid answered
And spent half an hour on toes
Smallest details she knows
All words she's heard thoroughly learned
Woes thoughts Mistress discerned
Master's pained tears concerns you'd moaned
Aside I stood as told
Hearing enough she strolled upstairs
Such words gave Kiều much scare
Such a woman is rare peerless
What talents What boldness
Thoughts of her stir numbness terror
At life's moves she's clever
Even Thúc yields to her hands tied
Affair's proofs she's descried
Envy's blood makes all lives snarl frown
Yet cries were stilled and drowned
She'd talk and greet around kindly
Mundane is shown frenzy
Yet smiling in fury  that's sly
I must fear for my life
Beast's fangs snake's venom bind me now
With wings I'd soar unbound
For hands shall soon pluck flower high
Alluvia weeds don't mind
Fated to drift for life always
Yet alone midst strange place
Bare hands can't simply make warmth food
In the shrine thoughts ensued
Treasures of high value she'd see
For subsistence she'd seize
Drum's sounds of late Watch Three echoed
She'd climb past bloom-filled wall
Toward dim moonbeams she'd go westbound
Night's trees sand dunes hills stretched
Cocks crowed on fogged bridge etched shoes' marks
Lone girl trekked through the dark
Long road scared her plight sparked pity
Dawn shone on mulberries
Where was shelter This she'd not know
Far temple she'd behold
Seclusion's Call Shrine shown clearly
Kiều tapped its gates firmly
The shrine's nun heard quickly took in
The prioress Giác Duyên
Saw dark brown garb within grace thrived
Her tale she'd verify
Still foreign Kiều would hide details
Young nun's from Peking hailed
Heed mentor Buddha's trail orders
Mentor who'll come later
Had me bring these treasures to you
Gold bell silver gong too
In person offered two treasures
Prioress checked uttered
If Hằng Thủy's your mentor we're friends
Alone you've passed through lands
Wait few days for your mentor here
She'd rest in cloud-bound sphere
Eat salt pickles appear carefree
Sutras she'd learned wholly
Got used to lamps study incense
Palm tomes raised flag she'd tend
Night came light lamps dawn came sound bells
Prioress' respect swelled
For Kiều's skills so she felt safer
Spring's end had just arrived
Blooms' shades draped earth midst sky Moon lit
Clear clouds calm winds - placid
One devotee visit'd the shrine
The bell and gong he eyed
Lady Hoạn's are much like those two
Giác Duyên's worries ensued
Late night she then reviewed Kiều's tale
Secrets could not stay veiled
Kiều told her life's details wholly
Toward here fate has thrust me
Frail life's doomed or lucky you will
Giác Duyên listened grew still
Compassion terror filled her mind
Soft counsels she'd confide
To all Buddha's gate's wide open
Yet I fear misfortunes
Your life such incidents will mar
You should first hide run far
Don't wait for flood to start to rise
There lived Bạc clan nearby
Who oft offered the shrine tributes
She'd send message minute
To accept Kiều's refuge for now
Thinking haven was found
Kiều swiftly left without foresight
Yet they were hypocrites
Dames Bạc Tú worked same lines of trade
She saw Kiều's charms and grace
Thrilled to gain goods that'd pay richly
Dame Bạc made up stories
At once anxieties seized her
Rebuffs were cried harder
She'd shout harsh threats order union
Alone in far region
Your bad name's crossed distance far near
You'll bring ruins I fear
To shelter you who here will try
Nuptial home you should find
Or take refuge in high Heaven
No good place's adjacent
Afar no one's present around
Bạc Hạnh - by blood we're bound
Is my nephew not outsider
A Tai Zhou store owner
He's straight candid never tells lies
Listen to words of mine
Head there become his wife you should
None would know you none would
Midst vast seas long streams you'd be free
If you do not agree
Grave aftermath you'll see later
She'd knit her brows glower
The more she heard stronger woes grew
Homeless and strayed  Kiều knew
Twas her dead end out flew clamors
Swallow's from flock severed
Once shot it's scared of curved twigs now
Though troth's my sole way out
Face's known yet heart's enshrouded veiled
By chance should woes assail
Caught by flesh traders ailed I'll be
If I'm to be married
Let him pledge honestly his vow
By Heaven Earth it's bound
I'll then cross seas profound gladly
Bạc left once she'd agreed
Informed her clan readied wedding
The clan cleaned up bustling
Yard swept shrine set jars rinsed scents lit
Bạc Hạnh kneeled down - fast brisk
He'd boast and have gods witness vow
Midst yard he'd pledged aloud
Red-thread rite behind shrouds was done
To boat led her husband
To Tai Zhou boat quickened downwind
At port he'd fast begin
To leave first for routine venue
Twas an old lodge he knew
Flesh traders through and through likewise
They'd checked and set a price
Sold goods was worth ten times expense
A coach for her he'd rent
Bạc grabbed his cash and went his way
At flowered porch coach stayed
One inside hag surfaced briskly
Before altar stood she
Same white-browed god she'd see  brothel
With one swift glance she'd know
Caged bird could not circle high sky
Curse this bound fate of mine
Once loosened knot's now tied once more
My own life I deplore
Why born gifted to score Fate's spite
Water's once purified
Yet times again mud grimes water
Fortune's Wheel plagues frail girl
Much pain it's spun never stopping
Since I strayed from home kin
I've risked this life risking always
What sins has this youth made
Half Spring' lost still I'm braving woes
Fate's rule I must follow
I'll risk my youth forego my prime
Fall's wind was cool Moon clear
One client from frontier came round
With broad shoulders build stout
Tiger-beard silkworm-brows swift-chin
Hero's aura out streamed
An apt fighter esteemed strat'gist
To no-one he'd submit
From far Yue Dong hailed this Từ Hải
He'd roamed freely through life
Sword lute and oar sufficed his needs
He'd learned of Kiều's prestige
His respect for her eased strong will
When brought to rosy guild
They'd share a glance hearts filled with zest
Let's speak with hearts Từ stressed
For I don't fickly mess around
I've heard of grace renown
Worthy man you've yet found have you
Heroes in life are few
With jailed fish caged bird who'd bother
You're too kind Kiều answered
But humble self underrates none
Choose stone test gold's essence
To whom my heart's credence should go
I must please guests to fro
Thus cannot pick true gold from brass
Such heartfelt words dear lass
Recall Lord Ping Yuan's past verse lines
Come closer scrutinize
See any parts of mine you trust
Kiều spoke Your heart's vast just
Dragon-cloud Jin Yang must soon see
You praise weed bloom paltry
My stray life's not worthy of you
He'd nod pleased through and through
Laugh Soulmates are hard to come by
Kudos to such keen eyes
Hero midst dusty sights you see
With one word you know me
Boundless wealth and glory we'll share
Hearts harmonized then there
Love formed no pledge the pair uttered
He'd inform matchmaker
Kiều's bought price he'd cover squarely
Build manse chamber privy
Set gemmed bed eight-fairy curtain
Hero beauty were one
Phoenix pair matched dragon they'd ride
Six months love's hearth burned high
He longed to roam four skies swiftly
Far gaze viewed vast skies seas
With one sword lone horse he ran straight
Wives follow husbands' ways
To where you go she'd state I'll go
Từ spoke Our hearts we know
Why keep common girls' codes till now
Once skilled army is found
Rallies shake earth flags shroud all roads
Once superb name's well-known
I'll welcome you back home that day
Right now there's no fixed place
You'll hinder me when way's yet clear
Rather you wait right here
At most I'll take one year only
Words ceased horse left promptly
Peng's wings sailed winds to see far miles
Alone she'd stay behind
Lock chamber's doors through nights endless
Moss-filled yard who'd visit
Grass thrived willows - a bit - thinned waned
On far-off home eyes trained
Yearning tailed Jin cloud's lane distant
She ached for aged parents
Had their longing torments yet ceased
Ten years plus passed swiftly
Rough-skinned mist-haired they'd be if live
She'd mourn old pledge contrived
Heart's threads still clung though mind had quit
Her kin had he married
Now they'd have lots of kids - maybe
Drifter missed home country
Stray thoughts crisscrossed every which way
Swan's wings soared faraway
On distant skies drained gaze focused
Days nights she'd wait anxious
Nearby war's pernicious flames raged
Death's air dimmed skies like haze
Soldiers armors arms raided roads
Neighbors gave her counsels
To find shelter lie low for now
She said By oath I'm bound
Though danger's nigh I shall not flee
She lingered skeptically
Rally's cries flags she'd see outside
Soldiers weapons drew nigh
Chorused Who's the Lord's wife Please show
Two lines ten generals
They'd take off arms bow low fore her
With fair court's maids servers
We'll bring you home ordered the Lord
Phoenix carriage she'd board
Don lustrous crown sun-colored clothes
They'd sound drums with flags closed
Flutes lutes preceded gold carriage
Red token sent message
South-Court Camp's assemblage drums noised
Bastion's guns roared flags hoist'd
Lord Từ himself deployed to hail
Known face strange gauze cap belt
Same swift-chin silkworm male eyebrows
He'd laugh Fish stream are bound
My past words do you now recall
Hero fathoms hero
Are you content with all you see
Though young and frail said she
Blessed vine can count on tree's great shades
Though your fruits I now face
My heart's been sure since day one two
Eyes met laughter broke through
They'd go to shared room to confide
Throw feast for troops as prize
War drums martial tunes piped shrilly
Wealth cleansed past miseries
Fresher their love would be each day
While feast was joyous gay
She'd narrate drifting days calmly
Of Wu Xi of Lin Zi
Of fraud and anguish she'd gone through
Though I'm now free from blues
Some debts favors still do linger
Lord Từ listened to her
Displeased he'd show thunderous rage
Steel troops pick men posthaste
Order men to migrate promptly
Wave red flags split army
Two for Wu Xi Lin Zi left straight
For those who'd wronged her fate
They'd search names take away question
Sent heralds with pennants
To house-arrest sentenced Thúc Tribe
They'd send summons invite
Old maid Giác Duyên as high callers
All was told to soldiers
Solemnity anger all showed
Heaven's vengeance was known
They'd net all in one go cleanly
At camp stood armed soldiers
Inner troops queued outer formed lines
All were apt dignified
Cannons banners would hide the floor
Midst camp on seats for Lords
Sat Từ his wife before soldiers
First drum round yet faltered
By camp's gate prisoners were named
Từ spoke All debts all shames
Are yours to judge to blame clearly
By divine majesty
Please repay those worthy she'd state
Repay then vindicate
That's up to you Từ said to try
Sword's tip to Thúc would fly
Pale-faced he'd - like a snipe - shake wilt
Debt weighs like thousand hills
Lin Zi's old mate you still recall
Apart - I failed wife's role
Whose fault Still I shan't fault old mate
Small thanks debts I'll repay
Thousand silver brocades hundred
Your wife's wily wicked
Now thief old lady's hit upon
Ant's crawled bowl's rim not long
Foul scheme's favor's hereon repaid
Poor Thúc seemed ill afraid
Sweats like rain soaked his face body
Heart was torn by fright glee
Scared for his wife happy for her
Old maid nun came after
To high seats Kiều ushered promptly
Hands held face shown said she
Hua-nu Trạc Tuyền are me alone -
When stray soul was dethroned
Gold hills can't repay shown kindness
Thousand gold' small largess
No gold' weight can tie with kind souls
Bewilderment they'd show
Both fear and joy were sowed inside
Please stay sit for a while
Look closely witness my vengeance
Brought were captives present
Who'd wait to be questioned by her
Unsheathed sword midst banners
Named Lady Hoạn major felon
Kiều fast showed reception
Here Young Lady's present lastly
Few women rival thee
Such face heart history's seen few
Kindness's women's virtue
The fouler the more rueful pained
Hoạn's soul was banished drained
Head kissed the earth mouth strained weaved pleas
A woman's heart's in me
By nature jealousy's normal
Think of sutras temple
Of why no-one followed past flight
Deep down deep respect lies
Yet one can't just divide one's spouse
Much pain I've brought about
May sea-wide heart allow mercy
My compliments said she
Such words are praiseworthy and wise
You're blessed if I don't try
If I do petty I'll be then
It's good that you repent
Kiều ordered guards free went the wife
She bowed midst court obliged
From gate guards dragged a line of men
By vast Heaven cried then
Who hurts others shall end up hurt
Bạc Hạnh Dame Bạc came first
Near stood Hound Hawk perverse Sở Khanh
Dame Tú Mã the Scholar
Did those crooks deserve her mercy
Based on what vows they'd weaved
Ordered guards would carry them out
Flesh shattered blood dropped down
No witness was without terror
All's by Heaven's order
Who wrongs others others will wrong
Those whose vice crafts burn strong
Reap what's sowed for pleas throngs shan't feel
Troops crowded trial field
In broad daylight all steeled witnessed
Once vengeance was finished
Giác Duyên fast spoke her wish to leave
Kiều said Rare chance's perceived
Old friends' meeting's conceived seldom
Apart clouds weeds shall come
To where clouds herons from here stray
Not for long nun would say
We'll meet half a decade later
To far land I wandered
Nun Tam Hợp - a seer - I faced
Reunion's times she said
This year next half decade we'd meet
Foretold vision's concrete
Hence future sight I'll heed fully
Fortune binds you and me
Our chances are many - why rush
Kiều In presage I trust
Tam Hợp's prophecy must be true
Meet her once more should you
Of my ending please do query
Giác Duyên concurred truly
She'd bid adieu swiftly set out
Since rights wrongs were quelled now
Inner woes' tides - she found - decreased
Before Lord Từ kneeled she
I never thought I'd see this day
By thunder you relay
My heart's rid of huge weights inside
Debt's in bones guts inscribed
Which even when I die shan't fade
Eras' best men he'd say
Chose soulmates in one day like so
Those with hero's titles
On roads act when troubles occur
This is household's matter
With thanks why'd you bother regard
Poor your parents afar
In Jin In Yue - you are severed
Till one house all gather
Once they see you flattered I'll be
Troops' banquet was readied
Countless soldiers would see wrongs cleansed
Army' morale soared high
Whole nation knew their might power
Their court ruled one corner
Half the state fell under its reign
At times strong as storms rains
Five South's districts they'd gained control
Midst dust-wind one honed sword
Scorned who'd eat dress and know no pains
Border's lands were his reign
Where many suzerains he'd raised
His banners none would face
Five years he's ruled this place's shores lands
Came one trusted state's man
Named Hồ Tôn Hiến  Commander grade
He by the King's dictate
At will led troops to slay rebels
Knew Từ as great hero
Knew Kiều discussed martial matters
He'd bait for surrender
He'd still troops send treasures to bribe
Kiều's own tributes came by
Thousand-pound gems two fine court's maids
At camp news was relayed
Lord Từ's own mind was vague torn still
This reign my own hands built
Chu's seas Wu's streams at will I've roamed
If I bowed to Ming's rule
As shamed subject how would fate be
Robes codes would confine me
Grand titles would prove meaningless
While with free reign like this
This might who dares dismiss defy
At will stir seas pierce sky
No man's within this life higher
Kiều trusting by nature
By sound words rich treasures was swayed
Like drifting weeds I've strayed
Much anguish's cursed frail fate of mine
With a King's vassal's life
Blue cloud's pathway is wide open
He'll gain I'll gain - all's done
A trip home - I'll plan one later
As crown statesman's partner
I'll gain esteem honored they'll be
For the state then fam'ly
Duty and fealty achieved
Better than boat midst stream
Exposed to all extreme currents
In time of discussion
She'd seize her chance balance cons pros
Much kindness Highness shows
It's sprayed widespread and sowed deeply
His grace's brought long-lived peace
The people are greatly grateful
If you wage wars struggles
Wu Ding's bone heap will grow head-high
Your name shall be defiled
Thousand years Huang Chao's life who's praised
Rather fortune high place
To eminence that way's certain
Từ saw her words' reason
Offense to submission agreed
He'd greet envoys swiftly
To disarm disband he'd announce
Trust in surrender's vow
Flags seemed askew drums' sounds slackened
Ignored martial actions
Were confirmed by agents as true
Such chance Lord Hồ fast used
With rites he'd hid ambush preplanned
Peace signed flags first advanced
Rite's wares moved up bronze cannons hid
Obtuse Từ knew not this
Toward gate in rite's outfit he'd go
Lord Hồ gave prompt signal
Guns roared three sides flags rose four sides
Caught by sudden surprise
Helpless would sacred tigers be
Till death he'd fight not flee
Commander's bravery he'd show
For Heaven left his soul
Tall he stood midst circles of men
Firm as stone and bronze then
He could not be moved when shaken
Troops would massacre hunt
Death's air thundered and stunned all lives
Ramparts bunkers were wiped
To there Kiều was led by wild troops
Midst arrows stone shots' loops
Từ beneath vast skies stood firmly
Wits might you had plenty
This end's because of me my view
How'll disgraced me see you
Rather this day I too perish
Her tears rained down sadness
She'd still near him she'd dip her head
Grudges' auras would wed
Từ fell as her head met the ground
Soldiers who stood around
Pitied her pulled her out slowly
To camp she was carried
Lord Hồ saw tenderly conveyed
A beauty of ill fate
Caught in war's throes dismays - Pity
Court's scheme's reaped victory
Yet your words helped achieve this gain
Objective's been attained
What favors you'll obtain as prize
Harder gushed tears pearl-like
Slowly she'd vocalize heart's woes
Từ was a great hero
Across skies seas he roamed freely
Due to his trust in me
Though peerless he agreed to yield
We thought fame wealth we'd wield
Not sudden death midst field of war
Five years freely he soared
Yet hollow death was scored for naught
Feats - you said - my words wrought
Yet listed feats just brought more grief
I've caused more sins than feats
From worthless life relief I crave
Please grant a shallow grave
For august man to stay buried
Lord Hồ showed some pity
By river Từ's body was laid
Troop's feast revered triumph
Soldiers gathered midst strummed lutes flutes
Forced Kiều by blinds served food
Drunken lord forced her lute's best tune
Like mournful rains typhoons
Fingertips' blood had strewn four strings
Trumped cicadas' ape's sings
Hồ listened tears dripping and frowned
From where is this tune found
Countless torments such sound conveys
Kiều spoke It's called Bleak Fate
I myself wrote in days of old
While young this I composed
And now bleak fate unfolds in life
Sounds sight bewitched ears eyes
Steel face was softened by passion
Ties of wife and husband
Snapped lute's strings who'd fasten for thee
I'm an outcast said she
Spouse's unjust death's on me this day
Withered bloom has no place
Like Xiao Lian's strings heart stays broken
Spared by your compassion
Home's sight's a good fortune to me
Too drunk wasted was he
At dawn Lord Hồ fully recalled
As state's core official
Above outside eyes pored over
Not some wanton player
How'd he solve this matter soundly
Day lit his agency
On one scheme he'd firmly decide
Lord's words who'd dare defy
Forced Kiều must wed a tribe's statesman
Old Thread Weaver's irksome
Random red threads are spun rashly
Coach made for boat straightly
Lamps lit up draperies dropped down
Peach hues paled sad brows frowned
Her whole being was drowned in woes
Unto sand tides I'll go
Cheat folks' favors forego bright life
Float to deep seas far skies
In death where'll bones of mine go to
Oh bound red thread who slew
Oh debts who forced into my hands
Here how did my life land
What days I have left shan't bear worth
Living is without mirth
Then let my life to earth return
Alone much grief I've learned
Let gem be smashed gold spurned shattered
West hills Moon hid under
Alone she'd stand lower - shaky
Strong tides thundered loudly
Twas Qian Tang river - she was told
She'd recall dreams of old
It's here ill fate beholds its end
Đạm Tiên you're there old friend
Receive me as vowed then down there
She'd compose by lamp's flare
One last poem as farewell note
Spread gemmed veils on the boat
Sky soared stream stretched - untold endless
Lord Từ showed vast kindness
I failed his trust for this state's sake
Killed spouse new mate I'll take
Can such disgrace partake in life
It's better if I die
Entrust my heart to sky river
She viewed the vast water
Then threw herself under strong flows
Though statesman fast followed
Gem scents had been swallowed wholly
Pity one's destiny
Gifted talents beauty cursed life
She'd known woes of exile
What'd she have left once plights had ceased
Fifteen years woes plenty
For girls examples she had set
What a tragic kismet
Once yin peaks yang offsets - who knows
Those whose loyalty's shown
Why'd Heaven long set woes on them
Since Giác Duyên left Kiều's place
She'd held her gourd always journeyed
Priestess Tam Hợp she'd see
Of Kiều she thoroughly questioned
One with faith compassion
Why's she plagued by torments and plights
Though weal woes Fate decides
From man's hearts she replied All start
Fate rules so do man's hearts
Prudence's bliss love imparts hazards
Though Thúy Kiều's fine clever
As all rose cheeks suffers bleak fate
Strong passion in her stays
To which she obligates herself
In weal she'll not long dwell
Harmony will be felled shattered
Phantoms demons guide her
She'll tread paths of adversity
She'll face catastrophes
Twice in brothels twice she's a maid
Midst swords unsheathed spears raised
Among wild beasts no place's settled
Midst turbulent rough flows
'Fore dragon's jaws she'll throw herself
Woes follow passion well
Alone she'll taste and tell no-one
Life Death are harsh undone
Suffer till ill fate's run its course
Giác Duyên listened distraught
Alas What's left but naught in life
Priestess spoke It'll be fine
Merits will rectify karma
Thúy Kiều's sins debts thus far
She's trapped in love unmarred by lust
Paid deep debts with thoughts just
She sold herself faith's touched Heaven
She kills one saves thousands
Knows right from wrong decent from base
Such merits none equate
Past's sins are thus erased cleanly
Good souls Heaven shall please
Grant future's bliss and ease past's dues
Miss your old friend should you
Then sail down Qian Tang to fetch her
You should fulfill your words
Both Heaven's your favor it'll be
Giác Duyên listened seemed pleased
By Qian Tang's seashore she then stayed
Built grass-house roof thatch-laced
Blue sea gold clouds her place observed
Two enlisted anglers
Built boat made nets for a year's pay
No strains made set heart sway
What luck By stroke of Fate they'd meet
Since Kiều jumped in flows fleet
Sudden flows would soon lead her there
By thrown net Kiều was spared
Visions which Tam Hợp shared were true
On the boat silk robe strewed
Though drenched like glass face's hue was bright
Kiều - Giác Duyên certified
Was still deeply wrapped by slumber
In dream pure soul wandered
Đạm Tiên from days older appeared
I've long waited right here
Spent more than ten long years for thee
Heart's kind yet fate's dreary
Doomed yet heart shows unequalled shine
Heaven's seen heart pure-white
Sold self - faithful saved lives  humane
For nation's people's gain
Merit's scale wins against bleak fate's
From Doom's Scroll name's erased
And your poems I'll place with you
Much pleasure will ensue
Old troth's fulfilled bliss too prospers
Still caught within wonders
Trạc Tuyền she heard hollered by ear
Her dream fast disappeared
Confused who did she hear just now
Đạm Tiên was not around
On boat Giác Duyên perched down nearby
Her sight brought much delight
With boat tied they'd stop by grass-house
Share home day in day out
Eat salt pickles view cloud Moon breeze
Four sides filled with vast scenes
Tides rose all day clouds seized all space
Past's woes were cleansed effaced
Past's troth would at this place she find
While Kiều braved tragedies
Kim Trọng felt agonies untold
From Liao Yang's funeral
Six months passed home he'd go back to
To old Green Garden's View
Where sceneries seemed to have changed
Midst yard weeds thrived reeds waned
Windows unveiled walls rain-beaten
The site seemed abandoned
Last year's peach blooms vibrant midst breeze
Swallows circled lowly
Grass filled soils moss buried shoes' prints
Back walls filled with thorns splints
Along these paths they'd been last year
Twas still as a shrine here
His heart's feelings who'd hear them now
A neighbor came around
Kim asked questions found out events
Of Vương to court he went
Of Kiều she'd saved clansmen sold self
Of home twas somewhere else
He'd ask of Quan as well as Vân
All lived in misfortune
Sewed clothes wrote scrolls to earn their keeps
News like thunder struck deep
At once his life force seeped outside
For new address he'd pry
He'd swiftly leave to find their place
Grass-house mud-walls decayed
Sparse bamboo door with frayed blinds' rods
Yard's drenched grass filled earth sod
Both dread and awe then caught his mind
He'd shout out from outside
Quan swiftly at his cry ran out
Led Kim into the house
From the back the Vương spouses came
They'd moan as sobs wrecked frames
Have you heard what became of us
Kiều's fate is tenuous
Alas She failed your trust and vow
Household's mishap came round
She sold herself bailed out father
Countless woes followed her
Many times she uttered her will
Shared oath's effective still
Her place Thúy Vân will fill for her
Your kindness she answered
Deep pains in lives later she'll hold
This life love has failed troth
After Hell reborn soul shall pay
These firm words she relayed
When she left she'd engraved inside
Bleak is my daughter's life
Where'll you stray while Kim's right here now
Voiced woes grew more profound
As he listened pains sprouted more
Sobs wrecked frame tears outpoured
Tears cascaded gloom tore numb soul
He'd cry he'd faint in throes
Loop  woke cried swooned  would go anew
Pains of rift were acute
Unsurely old Vương soothed consoled
Wood's been made into boat
Bleak fate can't fulfill troths you've shared
Though pained for one out there
Show priceless self some care won't you
Hundred comforts out flew
Yet flames of sorrows grew only
Gold bracelets of pledge weaved
With old lute incense he'd left her
Kim looked pains grew stronger
Guts throbbed in grief anger profound
It's because I walked out
Made blooms drift weeds stray now cried he
Countless vows we have weaved
Stone vows bronze oaths conceived where now
Bed's unshared still espoused
My heart can't split what's bound our lives
As long as I'm alive
Costs time mean naught I'll find my mate
His love no words could say
With tearful words away he'd go
Fast fix house patio
Invite the aged couple to stay
In duty he'd engage
Care for parents in place of hers
Grind tear-mixed ink write words
Send agents have letters relayed
He'd spend much cash for aids
To Lin Qing - back forth - they'd journey
They'd spread out ask queries
Midst vast skies seas where'd she reside
Yearnings intensified
Flames burned steel guts pains sliced gold heart
Silkworm's belly grew starved
Cicada's frame chill-marred soon waned
He'd wake then faint again
Blood spilled with tears dreams reined his soul
Much dread parents would show
They feared that he would go too far
Wedding's plans they'd fast start
Vân would soon tie her heart with his
One with grace one with wits
Skilled lad fair lass in bliss tied knots
To home a wife he'd brought
Yet sorrows joy could not erase
Through their conjugal days
His love both new and aged deepened
When would old love lessen
Heart's skeins twisted torrents tears poured
At times on study's floor
He'd light scents lute of yore he'd play
Strings' sounds wailed in dismay
Fragrant smoke rose wind swayed the blinds
Near terrace on roof high
Gown's shade flitted voice nigh echoed
Heart was etched with vows old
Her thoughts made him behold her sight
Nights days were fraught with plights
Springs Falls had passed come by again
A test the King arranged
In one day Quan Kim gained honors
Sky's Gates Cloud's Path offered
Court's blooms welcomed motherland praised
Past deeds Quan's mind replayed
He'd see old Chung repay old debt
Shown kindness was offset
Two clans grew closer wedlock tied
Since Kim flourished in life
His thoughts of her had heightened woes
Who'd pledged vows of jade gold
Gold Gates Jade Dorm he'd show to whom
Duckweeds waves swept consumed
He'd thrived yet mourned one doomed to stray
To Lin Zi faraway
He'd bring wife kids obey decree
His new post was easy
Days nights crane's lute's sounds weaved delight
Midst chamber's peach-hued blinds
Vân slept and dreamed of sight of her
To him she'd then whisper
Faith and distrust severed his mind
Lin Qing Lin Zi alike
One change of sound devised error
Yet bound were soul-sisters
Perhaps good news answers lied here
In court he'd ask far near
Đô - an old clerk - came near answered
This ten-year case occurred
Name face I know for sure truly
Dame Tú Scholar Mã see
From Peiking they retrieved one lass
Lute's skills rhyme's flair she had
Thúy Kiều's grace charms surpassed all souls
Stubborn virgin was bold
She'd risk her life behold frauds lies
Mortal shames cursed frail life
With Thúc's her love's threads twined later
Yet first wife was bitter
To Wu Xi they took her dealt pains
She escaped from their reins
Met Bạc clan once again woes struck
Bought then sold what poor luck
Clouds adrift weeds unstuck would stray
Yet one person she'd face
With matchless might-wits stateliness
With skilled soldiers countless
Lin Zi was seized by his order
All rights wrongs she'd answer
Repay kindness tortures squarely
With fairness piety
She squared debts gained glory far near
Name - I know not I fear
From Scholar Thúc you'll hear wholly
Đô's words showed clarity
One letter to Thúc he fast wrote
Of her status he'd probe
Of her spouse kids he'd note their names
Thúc When crisis inflamed
At camp I asked and came to know
The lord Từ Hải once showed
Flairs in combats untold vigor
At Tai Zhou he met her
Flair and grace  no wonder they'd wed
For years he roamed far fled
Made Heaven Earth upset quiver
East lands troops took over
Yet I know not later accounts
Kim harked detailed recounts
Inner daze numbness bound his heart
Pity lone leaf apart
When'd it be cleansed discard caught dust
Flower flowed with stream's rush
Mourned afloat fate rued crushed old ties
Though vows were left behind
Both incense and lute's sight were here
Lute's strings produced sounds queer
Would their love persevere this life
Duckweed strayed in exile
How'd he in weal sit by calmly
Seal post he longed to cede
Through countless streams vales he would pass
He'd brave swords spears en masse
Risk his life to at last see her
Vast skies deep seas severed
Bird's shade fish's sight - wher'ver to find
For news he'd wait stand by
Rains shines swapped countless times over
Came five-hued cloud paper
His Highness' clear order arrived
Nan Ping - Kim was assigned
Fu Yang was Quan's prescribed office
They fast prepared carriage
They'd share one route and heed high rule
Hear rebels' reign fell through
Fu Jian and Zhe Jiang too settled
Kim asked Quan to follow
For her along the road they'd scout
To Hang Zhou they came round
They'd gain detailed accounts right there
On day of fierce warfare
Afield Từ to ploy's snare succumbed
Kiều won no premium
Was forced to wed statesman local
Jade was cast midst stream's flows
Such grace Qian Tang swallowed formed grave
Split took reunion's place
Whole clan thrived while she faced wronged end
They set tablet called soul
Set altar to cleanse woes by tides
Tides like white hills aligned
They thought they saw rose's sight fall down
Deep bond viewed sea profound
Where was Jing Wei's soul now bound for
What luck fate had in store
From elsewhere Giác Duyên fore them came
Eyes caught blessed tablet's name
Who are you she'd exclaim startled
Kinfolks from her household
She lives why do you mourn one live
News left them stunned surprised
They'd circle her inquire question
Here are parents husband
Here are siblings here's an in-law
Her sad news we long saw
What nun's said is an awe wonder
Nun said Fate bound me her
Lin Zi at first later Qian Tang
When she into stream sprang
I fetched her back to land brought her
At shrine we took shelter
Grass-temple is neighboring near
Though shrine's life's peaceful here
Homesickness domineers her mind
News filled all with delight
What pleasure could outshine this glee
Since leaf was from woods cleaved
They'd risked a lot to seize her news
Blooms waned scents fled  they'd mused
Next life they'd see one who'd perished
Thought life death had caused split
Now the live dead met midst life's sphere
Giác Duyên they'd all revere
After her they'd then steer promptly
They'd march cross grass split reeds
Though profound love conceived some doubts
By shore they walked around
They passed tall reeds and found the shrine
For Kiều Giác Duyên would cry
She'd swiftly step outside as told
Her whole clan she'd behold
Both parents were though old healthy
Both grown siblings she'd see
Along with Kim from the old days
Was it present time place
Wide-eyed she thought she'd faced a dream
Tears soaked robe's bib agleam
Joy mixed with grief thoughts streamed inside
In mother's lap she'd dive
Full tale was told midst cries and moans
By waves weed was far thrown
Fifteen years had since flown right by
Thought stream had claimed my life
I'd doubted in this life we'd meet
Two folks held hands took heed
Mien was - since she took leave - the same
Rains shines had Moon bloom maimed
Some of prime youth was claimed wasted
Joy could not be weighted
Greetings tales were cited briskly
Siblings fully queried
This sight made Kim feel glee shed woes
Fore shrine's steps they'd bow low
Both her rebirth grace shown they'd praise
Carriage was brought with haste
Old Vương told her to stay with them
Kiều spoke Plucked bloom's lithesome
Half of my life's succumbed to pains
On stream across sky's range
Who'd have thought I'd attain this day
Reborn loved ones I've faced
My heart's long yearning's sated filled
I'm at this shrine at will
This age grass trees fulfill finely
Pickles and salt suit me
Monk robe's hue I appreciate
I care not earthly states
Why'd I to realm dust-laced return
What'll halfway effort earn
Abstinence I shall learn for life
Nun's deed's sea-vast sky-wide
I can't leave her behind and go
Times vary old Vương spoke
Ways of abstinence show change too
Worship Buddha should you
Then obligations who'll cover
Great life's debt is honored
We'll build temple bring her home too
His words she'd adhere to
Bid nun and scenes adieu then go
Back at Quan's office post
Reunion's feast the whole clan threw
Slight tipsiness ensued
Vân stood up spoke her view aloud
In meetings fate endowed
Two souls met exchanged vows of troth
By mishap split was wrought
Hence younger sister caught pledged tie
Iron magnet are twined
Blood flows entrails inside soften
Long-kept aspirations
Fifteen-year affections are rife
Broken glass's now revived
Heaven's predestined prize's attained
Love lives and lover's gained
Old Moon shines oath's retained always
Too-ripe plum's essence stays
Peach's green - fast formulate marriage
At once Kiều fast dismissed
On old tales why insist till now
Though we did speak such vows
Winds rains have worn me out amply
More shame such talks conceive
Rather let tides recede wash all
Kim spoke Such words birth awe
Heart's set yet what of old past oath
We pledged that solemn troth
Thick Earth high Heaven both witnessed
Though things alter stars shift
Through Life and Death promise must stay
Fate gives love no dismay
Why would you bifurcate shared tie
Husband wife harmonize
She said Such love all strive to gain
I think in wedding's chain
Pistil Moon must maintain wholeness
Virginity's priceless
Or nuptial lamps transmit great shame
Since mishaps to me came
Bees butterflies have claimed pure soul
Rough squalls rains took their toll
All Moons lose roundness grown blooms fade
What's left of a spoilt grace
I seek naught now my days are through
With self I'm ashamed too
Dare not force filth into wife's role
Of your deep love I know
Yet nuptial lamps' sights show me shame
In sealed chamber heart's tamed
Though not a monk I've claimed one's life
Though love still weighs your mind
Instead of spouse be my dear friend
On marriage don't comment
My life'll be soiled woes will haunt me
Truly well said said he
But in truth there must be two sides
Since old in women's lives
Chasteness's diversified differed
At times normal altered
In changed times why concur with norms
Chasteness your duty's formed
What dust can smudge deform prized frame
By Heaven this day came
Fog dispersed clouds - the same - scattered
Waned bloom seems much fresher
Ten full Moons waned shimmer outshines
What doubts still vex your mind
Why make me turn my eyes from you
She heard his heartfelt views
With which her parents too concurred
With reasons drained from her
She'd sigh with head lowered and moan
Reunion's feast they'd thrown
Candles lit blooms red glowed midst shrouds
Face-to-face spouses bowed
All rites were set two spouses joined
Nuptial cups were enjoyed
Hearts rued old love new joint dazed minds
Since lotus shot peach thrived
Fifteen years had gone by till now
Love split joint - all around
Woes joys were shared throughout long night
Midst brocade veils they'd lie
Rose cheeks beneath lamplight glimmered
Lover rejoined lover
Old bee bloom together once more
She said My life's deplored
It's worthless to yearn for spoilt frame
For love which's stayed the same
Adhering I became your mate
Much shame in my heart stays
My thickened brazen face's ugly
If love's outward only
At faces I'm worthy to gaze
If you're too intimate
Covet earth's scents pluck aged flowers
Should impure acts occur
Love will shift to rancor promptly
Of you I'm unworthy
Love's like treason only tenfold
For lineage of household
My dear sister will hold my place
Chasteness though scant still stays
I'll safeguard it not waste remnants
There remain deep passions
Why pick a bloom shrunken to view
He said I pledged with you
For naught fish bird are through severed
I mourned one who'd wandered
Mourned solemn oath suffered deep woes
For love all lengths I'd go
United love's still whole complete
Mid-spring willow's still green
From love's cycle you'd weaned  I thought
Life's dust clear glass's not caught
To me your resolve brought more awe
I've sought pin midst sea's floor
Urged by firm oath not for lust gain
Now together again
Though birds bees are abstained we're mates
Clothes pin fixed she'd prostrate
Thick Earth high Sky she'd praise honor
Soiled frame's been cleansed filtered
Thanks to straight heart greater than all
Heartfelt words were installed
That's true empathy for one's heart
Much shelter he imparts
This night honor shan't part with me
Hand then held hand swiftly
For love faith love increased further
They'd add scents light tapers
Share wine with each other in glee
Memories gushed freely
For lute skills of yore he'd ask her
By fate's rule she answered
By wrongs I've been bothered till now
Regret can't turn things round
Out of respect I shall comply
On strings fey hands would glide
With incense tunes would rise echo
Sounds were like springtime's glows
Butterfly or Zhuang Zhou twas which
Youth-mourning tunes were rich
King Shu's soul or rail's pitch - which say
Clear as pearls in Moon's bay
Warm as Lan Tian's just-made jew'lry
Five tones ears heard wholly
Doles and joys notes conceived conveyed
Same song strange hands he'd state
'Twas once tragic now gay it sounds
Are joys blues to heart bound
Or cause woes end thus now comes glee
It's my small gift said she
Woeful sounds long trapped me in pains
Long has cognation reigned
From here never again I'll play
All thoughts they'd yet conveyed
Roosters had crowed new day arrived
Her will he'd tell forthright
Whole clan though first surprised praised them
She was strong-willed wholesome
Unlike those with wanton intents
Friendship love would well blend
They shared one bed and then chess rhymes
Sipped wine played chess at times
Watched flowers bloom nighttime's Moon rise
Wishes love were realized
Friendship marriage united fused
She had temple produced
Had one guide Giác Duyên to the shrine
Temple's gate was locked tight
Moss filled all chinks grass dyed ceiling
She'd gone herb-gathering
Like clouds herons straying toward where
For debts from past affairs
At shrine incense was there days nights
Wealth bliss spanned thousand lives
Kim's positions rose high higher
Housework deft Vân covered
Kim's home filled with vigorous boys
Peerless wealth bliss enjoyed
With Spring-filled yard name coiled in praise
All things Heaven dictates
Heaven ordains man's fate wholly
Doomed to stray stray you'll be
If born lofty loftiness's gained
Heaven fairly ordains
Talent Fate - none obtains at once
Why lean on one's talent
Talent and Misfortune form rhymes
Since karma's passed through time
Blame not Heaven far nigh for naught
From one's heart goodness's wrought
Heart equals thrice begot Talent
Long are home-brewed statements
They've brought some enjoyment this night
