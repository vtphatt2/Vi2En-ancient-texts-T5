The Tale of Kiều
Through hundred years in life
Talent and Fate are twined in hate
Through changes in ones fate
Seen things to hearts relay sorrows
Counterpoises law all know
Pages lamp shines over
Tell a romance covered in scrolls
In Jia Jings Ming of old
At peace both capitals stood high
There lived noble Vương clan
Whose wealth prestige was then modest
Followed customs harnessed honors
Blessed too with fair daughters
Lithe frames pure hearts were sung
Each born with perfect wondrous grace
Plump moth-feeler brows face Moon-round
Clouds praised her hair snow gowned her skin
Her skills and charms both dimmed Vâns shines
Spring-hill brows Fall-stream eyes
Willows begrudged blooms sighed envied
Glance made kingdom shaky
Flair few might match beauty none could
She was born smart and shrewd
Verse paint songs lute she knew them all
Knew well musics five tones
Lutes strings she plucked outshone others
Old tunes formed new number
Bleak Fate she stroked quavered all souls
Fair red-trouser well-known
Prime spring shed reached to hold suitor
Beyond discreet covers
East wall filled with wooers ignored
Spring came swallows soared high
Of ninety days gone by sixty
Pearly pear branch donned wee blossoms
Qing Ming of March had come
People swept tombs and stomped grasslands
Midst gay pilgrims of lands
Siblings bought garbs held hands and strolled
Sirs and madams to fro
Vibrant garments mingled with wheels
Papers alit round filled sham gold
Twilight would soon unfold
With hands entwined theyd go back home
Along a creek theyd roam
Admire landscapes green-combed beauty
Round curled a brook gently
Beneath a bridge bitsy traveled
By trail stood one mound old
With withered weeds raveled chartreuse
Incense heres naught Bemused I am
Here lies late songstress named Đạm Tiên
Grand talent with fine mien
Outside her steps men gleaned always
That branch Heavens scents sprayed
Her skills hed heard entrance he gained
Loves boat at port met pain
Pin snapped vase smashed - in vain hed tried
Her room was void of life
Horse wheels left tracks dimmed by grown moss
He cried for his love lost
fate tween them had caused rupture
This life love was severed
Next life his hearts reserved wholly
To coffin hearse hed see
Beneath this earth slept she after
To grave without owner
Moons phases passed never one came
Pearl-like teardrops down went from Kiều
To sad fates women yield
Before lifes woes we feel helpless
Creators too callous
Green youth beauty vanish quickly
As peoples bride lived she
Yet died as unmarried single
Wherere admirers of old right now
Incense candles I shall
Light up and offer bows none will
We meet by chance but still
By Yellow Springs please feel my heart
Soft whispered prayers shed start
Prostrate and bow toward lone tomb
On withered weeds dusk loomed
Winds swayed the tassels blooms gently
Hairpin atop shed seize
On trees bark etch a few verse lines
To trance Kiều was inclined
She would not leave in silence stay
Shadows darkened her face
Sad tears flowed ebbed cascaded down
With tears to spend around past soul
Kiều spoke Since time unknown
On us ill fates shown no mercy
This thought stirs pains in me
Will her fate one day be my own
Quan said Your talks forlorn
My ears hurt as you mourned for her
Cold air here has gathered
Kiều spoke Those with talents
Bodies perish latent souls stay
Soulmate Ive met this day
She may emerge just wait awhile
No answer was yet styled
A gust stormed forth meanwhile raving
Trees and buds were swaying
Scents were permeating with gale
After that wind theyd trail
Find prints on moss details crystal
Terrors dawned upon all
My prayer has been made known cried Kiều
We are soul-sisters still
Through life and death our wills gather
As thanks shed add further verse lines
Poets sorrows formed tides
On tree a poem - old-styled - was writ
Twas then they heard bells played nearby
A young scholar passed by
Hands reined his filly ride loosely
Scrolls filled his bag fully
Behind him tagged tiny servants
Colts fur snow dyed laden
Grass mixed with robes Heavens light blue
Spotted his face beamed hues
Hed fast dismount then move forward
While Quan hailed whom hed found
Shy maidens hid midst shrouds of plants
Hed come from nearby land
Both wealthy and able
Sky-born talent Earth-grown savvy
Fine in flair looks was he
Cultured inside stately outside
Because he lived nearby
Hed known Quan all his life from class
Of them his ears had grasped
Famed Tong Que Towers trapped beauties
Of those midst veils privy
Hed thought and sometimes weaved faux dreams
Now luck on him had gleamed
Hed come and found esteemed flowers
Brief glimpse he had procured
Though hearts approved eyes dared not say
Their minds were in a daze
Neither stayed nor in haste split paths
As he mounted shy lass glanced on
Clear stream gushed forth bygone
Bright Moon peeped through blinds space
Trees shades filled yard gold-laced waves roused
Eastward orchards trees bowed
Spring branches were weighed down by dews
Moonbeams shed mutely view
As countless thoughts imbued her mind
Ill-fated is her life
Wasted midst wealth delights it fades
Why did we meet this day
May our union take place or not
Her heart formed skeins of thoughts
A superb verse was wrought profound
Slant Moon shone on her shrouds
By sills sleep had her bound gently
Out of nowhere shed see
A maiden with comely sleek grace
Snow-dyed frame mist-white face
Surreal lotus feet swayed slowly
Startled Kiều stood to greet
From which Peach Spring have ye here strayed
Were sworn soulmates shed say
When the sun shone today we met
In cold home West I rest
Beneath a bridge down jettd streams flow
Few mourn this nether soul
showed my league leader
In Dooms Scroll woes after your fate
We share one boat one fates suffered
Once more may brush confer magic
Kiều thought on said topics
One fey brush stroke lyrics tenfold
With awe Tiên would behold
These lines are like fine brocade spun
To this first prize is won
Within Dooms Scroll to none it yields
To porch Tiên turned her heels
Kiều begged to continue talking
Strong winds through blinds blew in
Twas then she woke  dreaming shed been
Nowhere could Tiên be seen
Yet residual scents seemed to stay
She pondered though twas late
Shed feel for future fate worried
Adrift she knew shed be
What Fate planned she did see just now
Like stirring waves thoughts roused
She mused over and bawled further
Sobs pierced phoenix shutters
What ails you asked mother woken
With cheeks like blooms burdened by rain
You birthed raised me she strained
Two debts Ive yet commenced to pay
In my brief sleep shed paid visit
Dooms Scroll  just what is it
wrote on sent topics some songs
My future shall be wronged
What dreams foretold Ive long ciphered
False omen said mother
Whyd you search for dolor Just think
Kiều took her stern teaching
Torn she was then crying harder
Orioles chirps were heard
Blown catkins flew over next-door
Slant Moonbeams on roof poured
Alone with her thoughts more shed think
About the doting lot
None could cut their thin knotted wires
To study hed retired
Thoughts of Kiều in Kims mind still stayed
Three Falls equaled one day it seemed
Hence to roses bush hed dream his way
Oil waned Moons went away
Heart yearned for heart his face missed hers
Bronze-cold air filled chamber
Brushes dried strings never tuned lied
Cool winds swayed bamboo blinds
Tea lacked loves taste scents sighed longing
Were love not destined think
Whyd such gorgeous grace sting my eyes
He missed that scene her sight
To where theyd met hed stride swiftly
Grass dyed the earth wholly
Clear still water would greet his eyes
Reeds swayed back forth derided him
She filled his thoughts to brim
Grand gates blocked path forward
Stopped swayed red leaf blue birds straight flight
Willows cast shades thread-like
Perched parrot spoke to chide lone soul
Gates shut bolts locked thorough
Midst bloom-filled step where though was she
Behind one house hed see standing
Twas a merchants dwelling
Whose ownerd left trading elsewhere
As student hed rent there
His lute and books hed bear over
Trees thrived false hills covered
At that his joy would start
Heaven commands our hearts be twined
From rooms window oblique
Hed view the east walls sight daily
Nigh spring cave shut tightly
Since when he came over
Moons movements had covered two rounds
One day oer wall he found
One lithe form idling round peach trees
Lute dropped gown fixed dashed he
Scents were still there yet she was not
Around the walls hed spot
A golden hairpin caught midst boughs
Hed reach and pull it down
From sealed chamber to out here - why
Its hers  Our fates are twined
If not howd hands of mine hold this
Restless hed view laud it
Residual scents still whizzed about
At dawn the girl was out
Wildly looking around her fence
Kim had waited since when
Words from his heart hed then utter
Strange pin Ive recovered
Whom shall I give this pearl back to
From wall Kiềus voice passed through
Unselfish soul thank you truly
Its worth little money
Yet your kindnesss clearly ample
He said Why so civil
Strangers were not at all neighbor
In torments Ive suffered till now
Long waited days come round
Please linger and announce your mind
Hed fetch things from inside
Twin gold bracelets textile square cloth
It was her  he had not a doubt
Abashed she seemed throughout
Hed gaze at her shed shroud her face
Since we met hed then say
Ceaseless yearnings surfaced in me
Thin frames long grown fatigued
Who would have thought Id see this day
Whole month Ive sought your grace
Lovelorn Ive risked this fate waiting
Please answer a few things
On moss is glass casting its shine
Timidly shed reply
Though foods modest houses lifes snow-pure
Red thread of mine and yours
Parents rule if its sure or not
For frail one strong loves wrought
Yet Im young thus cannot answer
Now wind next rain batters
This chance rarely occurs said he
If you reject loves plea
Ones hurt yet one achieves nothing
Let us pledge with something
Well plan a matchmaking later
If loves by Fate severed
Wasted youth shall wither at once
My feelings if you shun
Wont vain love lead this one astray
She harked sound words conveyed
Her shy eyes looked away intrigued
Out of respect Ill heed your words
By me your hearts wavered
Etched on bronze stone never love fades
His joy gushed forth like waves
Gold pin rose cloth he gave to her
Here lifelong loves occurred
Take these as reminders hed say
Silk cloth gold pin shed trade
Give gold-etched fan away forthright
Firm oath was ratified
From backyard noises nigh theyd hear
Theyd flee in haste in fear
Hed make for home shed veer for hers
Since stone of golds gleam learned
Ardor thickened minds yearned always
Yearning would not abate be drowned
Snow and mist had wall bound
Loves words could not get round freely
Days nights would supersede
Red waned green thrived Spring season gone
Parents siblings were long ready
Theyd prepared garbs comely
Bought gifts for the journey with them
At home Kiều stayed lonesome
A chance to meet had come lastly
With seasons fruits ready
Lotus heels sprang swiftly to wall
From there a soft voice called
Midst flowers standing tall was he
Your heart cares not for me
Let flames incense recede and fade
Much dole longing Ive faced
Half of my heads now jaded white
By chance actions of mine hurt thee
This day my houses empty
give apologies to you
Round false hills she passed through
A passage which seemed newly fenced
Sleeves rolled shed free Peach Den
Tread clouds path to fey realm of gods
Face to face joy burned hot
Greetings small talks theyd swop utter
To study theyd venture
Theyd then exchange chatters loves vows
On desk racks tube she found
Up hung a sketch about green pines
Mists hues winds tints seemed fine
Subtle strokes came to life when viewed
He spoke This I just drew
Few words for worth please do grant it
On spare space twas a writ quatrain
Flair spills pearls hed exclaim
Lifetimes of abstinence
mustve lived to have won fine prize
She spoke Your form Ive spied
Either rich or inside Gold Gates
As bleak as is my fate
Has Fate bound us How may we know
Childhoods years I recall
A seer whod foretold future
Those whose skills charms emerge
Through eras theyve been hurt tortured
Can polar fates ever join not
He said By fate ties wrought
Gainst Heavens will mans fought some won
Should our knot come undone
This frame shall face weapons demise
Theyd bring all thoughts to light
Trade wines cups as love thrived inner
Merry day seemed shorter
West hills had long covered sunrays
No longer could she stay
She left her feet moved straight homebound
Once there some news she found
Her parents were still out feasting
Through the dark yard shed spring swiftly
On boughs Moon shone dimly
Hed barely closed his eyes
Though late she was coming closer
Hed been dreaming of her
Once roused awed by flower in sight
She spoke Ive on this night
For beau risked striding right toward here
Though were now staying near
Who knows if its a mere vision
Theyd write oaths on papers
Smooth hair lock knife severed in two
Midst sky glowed Moons bright hue
Two mouths at once swore to one vow
Thorough advice came out
On bones troth was carved now - always
Cups of fine wine theyd trade
Silk sash spread scents her shade glass caught
Airs cool Moons clear hed talk
In me burns one long-sought ardor
Proper rites yet occurred
She spoke Red thread joins souls
By oath our hearts are known fully
Except for birds for bees
Other requests shall see no nay
Famed for your lute hed say
Like Zhong Qi for your plays Ive longed
Its not great shed respond
Since you have asked some songs Ill play
Moon-lute at back porch stayed
Which Kim raised brow-high hastily
Whyd you notice make me bothered
Four strings were tuned to perfection
Played Han-Chu Contention
Clashes of bronze iron soared high
Rang dolefully like cries of pains
Like streams forth moving same with clouds
Cross-border Wang Qiangs sounds
Thoughts of Lord of home bound her will
Deep tones like falls half-stilled echoes
With fast-paced allegros like hail
Knees drawn head bowed ears yearned
Brows joined while innards churned tangled
Hed begin Such marvel
Therein agonys shown plainly
Played tunes are dark gloomy
Pain your own heart aggrieve others
Habits set she answered
Happy or sad Nature decrees
Valued words Ill concede
May dark moods be appeased lowered
Scents spread from bloomed flower
Glances conveyed eager passion
Lusts waves upset reason
Loving acts showed wanton intents
Tis no game shed dissent
Desist and listen then to me
Young peachs with scant beauty
Peach field dares not impede bluebird
A wifes role Ive entered
Stay chaste I must to serve my groom
Impure women for whom none crave
If this is done in haste
Lifelong chasteness Ill waste this night
Of all love tales of times
No dyad could be like Cui-Zhang
Rains clouds smashed stone bronze rang
Overzealous thirst sprang then ceased
They lived intimately
Yet inner scorns had squeezed both hearts
At West roof theyd depart
Love ceased in shame sweet start turned naught
If no resistances wrought
Who shall bear the shame brought later
Why soon rush shy flower
Alive Ill remember owed due
To him reason broke through
His love respect then grew tenfold
Pale shades outside weakened
From main gate came urgent calling
To her chamber shed spring
Kim crossed peach yard leaving quickly
With door unlocked hed see
A boy servant carry letters
Kims uncled expired
To home they must transfer remains
He must join the cortege out there
Fathers words made him scared
To her hed rush to bare trouble
Hed recite all words told
Hed for the funeral leave her
Weve yet exchanged all words
True union was never fulfilled
Moon our witness shines still
Though far apart hearts will stay twined
For three years on far miles
Long shall knot stay untied  O woe
So I afar may know some peace
She harked with heart heavy
And then hesitantly answered
Troublesome Thread Elder
Conjoined were yet severed were now
By sacred oaths were bound
Hair may turn gray love vowed shant wilt
For months years Ill wait still
My far-flung man I will grieve for
Weve pledged our hearts accord
For life lute wont board foreign boat
Long shall hills stand streams float
Return to whom youve coaxed this day
Joined hands would not part way
Bright sun past roof had stayed upright
Slowly hed leave steps slight
Tears flowed once his goodbye was weaved
Colt reined bags heaved swiftly
Woes were split each step cleaved joined route
Strange scenes mournful soul found
Sparse swifts afar rails howls from trees
His lovesickness increased each day
At West porch she remained
Mixed feelings snarled like skeins of threads
Shed view skyline ahead
Willows withered blooms fresh hues died
Back in thoughts plagued her mind
Her clan from partys site was there
Greetings theyd not yet shared
The yamens bailiffs snared the house
Armed with swords cubs throughout
The hellish beasts stomped round fiercely
Father son their cangues seized
One merciless rope leashed two lives
They buzzed round like blow flies
Destroyed baskets and wiped out looms
They stole gems clothes heirlooms
And filled their greed bags womb wholly
Whod bound them with misdeed
This felony whod weaved like so
They asked and came to know
A silk merchant had called for them
Protests shook earth wrongs summed dimmed clouds
All day theyd beg and bow
Deaf ears heard naught straight down flew hands
Hung heels tied by wronged strand
Hard rocks would break no chance for flesh
Horrors on faces etched
Could Heaven help Far-fetched it seemed
Twas bailiffs old routine
To gain money theyd scheme torture
To save poor kin of hers
In changed time shed observe changes
Of love and duty which weighed more
Twas troth which shed ignore
With mind made up shed yell
For my father Ill sell my life
There was old Chung  a scribe
The old servant was kind at heart
He saw her faith impartd
Pity for her would start in him
Three-hundred tael was deemed needed
They were house-arrested
In three days shed submit owed pay
Poor young child cursed by fate
From all shed be severed
Howd she mourn love when her selfs spurned
Raindrop cared not woes earned
Shed risk her life return merits
Matchmakers heard her wish
To all corners news whisked swiftly
One hag from their county
One far-hailed suitor she brought in
Scholar Mã hed begin
Hometowns in nearby Lin Qing land
Past forty was this man
With clean-shaved mug and handsome duds
Master aids were raucous
Upstairs hed head as ushered so
High seat he smugly stole
The matchmaker then called out Kiều
With each step made tears spilled in flows
Shy bloom feared mists and squalls
Ashamed at her shadow bold-faced
Hands hair hag forced down traced
Sad as aster as wastd plums limb
Force lute give fan and theme test rhymes
The guest was gratified
Hed probe to improvise his deals
Wedding gifts how much will they be
Worth thousand gold is she
Hag spoke Theyre desprate please show grace
Bargains  back forth  theyd state
Four hundred tael was placed lastly
Deal sealed things sailed smoothly
Birthdays cards would then be viewed swopped
With cash in hands woes stopped at once
With old Chungs assistance
Old Vương was thus pardoned for now
Their sight brought grief profound
Old guts shrank tears bled out much pained
Ive wished you would have gained
A worthy match obtained fine spouse
Such woes Heavens cast down
Whos framed us made our house severed
Axe old frame could weather
Yet wronged childs pains foster more pains
Soon or late life must end
rather die now than suffer
Words made tears flow harder
On lime wall hed hammer his skull
They fast stopped his impulse
Softly his daughter lulled his grief
Worthless is youth I keep
If dutys not a whit repaid
Tree grows old as time flies
Yet countless boughs are by it raised
If your love for me stays
Rainstorms will likely slay us all
Rather alone I fall
Bloom drops while tree stands tall leafy
Think me a sprout relieved while green
Let no rash thought set in
Yourself youll hurt your clan youll raze
Ears heeded sense conveyed
They stared while tears cascaded down
He signed their pact allowed them gold
Thread Elders callous cold
Blindly ties threads follows no frame
In hands once cash was claimed
Black white swapped hearts grew tamed quickly
Chung helped much as could be
With gifts offered so ceased charges
The clans trouble halted
Weddings time was prompted posthaste
Alone by lamp she stayed
Grief snarled her hair tears sprayed soaked gown
Come what may still Im bound
Bound and pained by the vow weve sworn
Through much for love hes yearned
But loving me has earned him naught
Dried up oaths cups have not
Yet Ive wronged him this troths effaced
Howd he think Ive betrayed his faith
Though countless vows were placed
Tis the end of this fate surely
Next life should bond not cease
Reborn horse ox shall see to debts
Her private thoughts wandered
Tears drenched kerchief saucers oil dried
By lamp she sat and tried soothing
Heavens caprices startling
Alone youre shouldering our woe
Its late why sit in throes
Private affair tangles your heart
Hearts brimmed with pains shed start
Tangled loves thread still marks my soul
Ashamed to have it known
But keeping this would show treason
My request please hearken
One bow Ill give reason Ill state
My loves yoke snaps halfway
Mend severed thread I pray you will
Shared days fans nights cups sealed loves oaths
Then came sudden storms growth
Duty troth cant be both fulfilled
Your own Springtimes long still
Pity your blood please fill my vows
Though flesh rots bones break down
smile in death allowed good name
Gold hairpin sheet of claim
Guard these items the same with troth
Should married life unfold
Remember me whom woes cumbered
Shared oaths incense with the Moon lute
One far day if you should
Burn incense pot fine tune these strings
Feel faint breezes passing  Thats me
My soul bears troth heavy
Even in death Ill see to dues
From earth far from Diyu
With cleansing drops please do bless me
Pins snapped glasss smashed wholly
Loves thoughts cant be fully conveyed
Thousand bows for my mate
Short red string broke away quickly
Strong waves will sweep posy away
From now Ill have betrayed your trust
She then fell unconscious
Breaths stilled hands were gelid as brass
In out servants amassed about
Herbs cure were brought around
Fresh tears flowed though faints bout just passed
What happened Old Vương asked
Kiều kept sobbing aghast speechless
In fathers ears Vân hissed
From hairpin oaths sheet this begins
Now this failed pledge your kin will bear
Whose fault split destined pair
As duckweed cloud youll fare straying
Your will about Ill bring
Shed bow and softly say
Father my debt please pay squarely
mind not fate paltry
Fear not my bones buried far-flung
Countless sorrows theyd sung
South towers drum had rung pressing
Sudden coach came waiting
Shed leave loved ones behind
Tears soaked through rocks hearts skeins severed
Dark clouds atop gathered
Grass wilted down under dew dropped
At lodge bridal coach stopped
Four besieging walls locked her in
She felt shamed toward hair mien
For her fate shed begin laments
From shine and hail in vain guarded
Stray fate had I noted
Peach stamen Id have split for Kim
By me East Wind was screened
His failed wish here ails him afar
Rejoin should path of ours
What hopes left for a marred body
Born into vagrancy
Pointless is my beauty this life
On table laid a knife
In kerchiefs fold itd lie covered
This knife shall deliver my fate
Falls night idled away
Alone half-roused she stayed distraught
That Mã was shed known naught
A seasoned rake who sought curt games
Hed seek fresh fund midst realms bawdy
In one brothel reigned she
Dame Tú  an elderly harlot
A chance meeting Fate brought
They were alike both fraught with lies
Joined fund built store lived by
Whole year theyd sell scents dyes smoothly
Across markets countries
Bought girls as maids whod be debased
For hapless soul ill fate was spun
Poor girl with elegance
A bloom bought to merchants canoe
Their scam shed got into
With cheap gifts impromptu rites date
Flag now in his hand stayed
Gem-like grace made heart sway harder
Astral scent Earths treasure
Thousands of gold deserves her smile
To first claim bloom worthwhile
Nobles rich folks shall vie for turn
Three hundred tael itll earn
Square spent cash then return profit
Before mouth lied tidbits
Spent gold he missed Skys gift he craved
Low hand Heavens peach lades
On this earth how many
Men know how pure those pleasing lusts
Wholeness Ill readjust
With pomgranates juice blood from combs
fool those common folks
Theyll pay the same as normal  So
Should old hag complain though
On-knee session Ill throw for her
On these remote corners
That I do naught shall stir queries
Was defiled by the bees entrance
Wild storm wrought disturbance
Cared neither gem fragrance nor spice
Vague was that nuptial night
By wedding lamp she lied ignored
Private teardrops outpoured
Disdained oneself deplored ones guest
Hes but a filthy pest
Womens name my prized fleshs sullied
What hope is left for me
My lifes accordingly finished
Rued love scorned fate blended
Knife drawn shed relinquish her life
But then she stopped revised
fine with death are my parents
Were there a consequence
Theyd bear repercussions for me
Woes will with time decrease
Soon or late death shall seize my life
She thought hard of her plights
Through walls rang cocks loud cries booming
Lookouts horns hailed morning
Mã urged her Were leaving promptly
Heart-wrenching split thered be
Colts hooves hobbled bumpy wheels rolled
After ten miles on road
Vươngs sendoff fest followed after
Outside host guests gathered
While mother child conferred inside
They stared tears bled like tides
In mothers ears confided Kiều
Born a girl  shame I feel
My debts to you when will I pay
Lifelong feelings Ill place with thee
His antics I did see
Tricked by a skilled phony I fear
At lodge hed not stay near
Of words hed speak crudely
Hed lord with flippancy toward mate
It seems hes not so straight
This ones a  I daresay - peddler
What have I left mother
In distant soils interred for sure
Dame Vương heard words outpoured
Wished to split Heaven pour outcries
Farewell wines cups yet dried
Outside Mã pressed for flight early
Heart fraught with empathy
Fore colts Vương fervently begged bowed
Green-peach willow-frail spouse
Through homes mishap shes now taken
Shell brave rains shines burdens alone
May grand pines shades be loaned
So vines from snows mists shown shelter
Words ceased Mã then answered
Red strings bound Im to her fastened
From here on whatll happen
Sun Moon witness demons blades slay
Coach left at tempests pace
As though flying toward place beyond
Wet eyes sought carriage gone
At far horizon spawned theyd peer
Frosts bleached the bridge dark clouds dimmed roads
In cold gales reeds huddled
Falls skys sorrows were all on her
Dark nights routes mists covered
Shed view the Moon rue the shared vows
On falls leaves reds endowed
Birds cries like folks profound feelings
Through strange streams hills crossing
Month passed theyd arrive in Lin Zi
At gates her carriage ceased
One from back drapery emerged
Pale skin she first observed
Soaring bulging was her physique
Brazen greetings shed speak
Charming dames stood in lines
Four five patrons sat nigh loitered
Mid-house stood grand altar
With one white-browed figures image
Twas brothels old practice
Trade-founders heritage they prized
Brought incense sticks blooms by to pray
To him luckless dames cried for grace
Undraped fore him shed stay
Light up incense then pray softly
Neath mat placed blessed posy
Toward her approached birds bees ample
Kiều was in awe puzzled
As told she bowed as old hag prayed
May fortune bless our trade
Nights be Hanshi while days Yuan Xiao
May countless guests come round
Parrots nightingales crowd their mates
Countless letters be placed
Front doors send off back gates welcome
Strange words hit her eardrums
Such shady notions drummed her mind
Thus concluded the rite
Dame Tú cross-legged sat high on bed
Bow to your Mum she said
To Dad there bow your head as well
His mistress Im impelled to be
Parrots nightingales ye swapped - Why
Weddings gifts he brought by
With him Ive lived and lied till now
Whyre our ranks upside down
Fit of hellish anger shed throw
Hey Hey Now this I know
From me this burglar stole my mate
Have her serve to create profit
Itchy to first test this cargo
Silks worths been washed dissolved
Gone Gone My cash will flow to naught
This wench here I have bought
My houses rules youll be taught to heed
When that swine bared his greed
Why not slap him why ceded so
Docilely you followed
Youre green yet itched to show lust thirst
My rules shant be traversed
Leather knout Tú grabbed headfirst charged in
High Sky thick Earth herein
long dead cried Kiều since leaving
have naught left to cling
She searched her sleeve baring dagger
Tú feared her last wager
As Tú still stared downward went blade
Fair grace fine wits were frayed
One vicious thrust to slay lifes thread
News of her wrong far spread
Like sedges folks congestd inside
Tú was trembling meanwhile listless
To west wing shed insist
Doctors be brought enlist porters
Kiềus life was yet severed
One dame appeared by her in dreams
Hissed Karmas yet redeemed
From ill fate you cant scheme to flee
Bleak womans fates yet ceased
Man cant change Fates decree at will
In Qian Tang River well gather
Whole day shed been doctored
Nearby Dame Tú shed see
Shed soothe so woes would cease for her
Life is lived once my girl
Spring buds sprouting further itll grow
Toward you errors were showed
Wrongly Ive forced a golden flint
Here already youre in
Stay in sanctum waiting for spouse
Alive your worths still sound
Find worthy match from house proper
One wrongs worth not rancor
You hurt yourself others as well
By ears rang pleas heartfelt
Recalled dreams prophecy
This lifes debts had yet waned
Next life would she obtain fresh dues
Kiều listened thought things through
Politely spoke None do wish this
If its true such is bliss
Yet later on will it be so
rather die than fall depraved
Words told from heart shall stay thus true
Should I later fail you
Heaven observes refutes that lie
Firm claims were vowed with might
Kiềus distress thus grew light lighter
Secured in Jade Tower
Far hills nigh Moon were her few friends
With gold sand dunes dirt trends dyed red
Fore clouds nights lamp grieves bled
Thoughts and scenes made heart shreddd in two
Moon-witnessed cups  she rued
Missed he whod seek her news in vain
Could ardent heart be cleansed cleanly
Rued folks whod wait firmly
Whod warm their beds whod repel heat
Homes yard light raved rains beat
Could decandras trunk fit embrace
Shed view dusks port away
Whose distant boat still waved its sails
On rivers mouth eyes fell
Stray blooms were washed by swells toward where
Shed view parched grassland there
Merged horizon earth shared blue hue
View cove on which gales blew
Roaring sea waves ensued round her
Midst foreign hills waters
Pains of exile authored quatrains
Through wall echoed replying rhyme
Twas one in his youths prime
Fine countenance refined vestments
She thought him a student
Sở Khanh was name given to her
He too seemed enamored by sight
What fragrance grace divine
What woe has led your kind toward here
Your worths not of mans sphere
Whyd proud flower you smear your name
Curse old Heaven  for shame
This wrath who feels the same with me
Heros heart should beaut see
Hell promptly set you free from binds
Falls sills had closed outside
Firm claims within her mind echoed
She thought of him selfs woes
Touched by kindness bestowed to stray
Shines rains had passed away
How long would woeful fate haunt her
All pains her note conveyed
Of her exile repaid homes woes
Soon as dawns mists dissolved
She had messenger go to him
Gold west sun idly dimmed
Reply then arrived in her hands
On flowered note hed sent
Two words - Tích Việt  were grandly scribed
Deftly she analyzed
The twenty first Canines hour
To woods late birds fast hurled
Camellia covered half-Moon
East wall trees shades were strewn
Through tipped sills Sở Khanh soon entered
Though shy she still ventured
To bow softly tenderly say
Like foams and weeds Im swayed
Like a lost bird Ive strayed toward here
beg your aid sincere
This favor Ill revere for life
not one who desires debts
Lusts seas Ill squarely set  Ive vowed
What method have you found please guide
Khanh I have wind-swift rides
Tough underlings outside also
Lets seize this chance and go
Of thirty-six schemes know whats best
Storms may rave rains may press
With me none shall suppress your leave
Proud words birthed disbelief
Twas too late so shed leap onward
Resigned to what Fate stored for her
Downstairs theyd both slither
Rife steeds - ahead after - made haste
Falls night languished away
Aft hills Moon hid gales swayed leaves fell
Mist bleached grass tint on trail
Homebound feelings would swell each pace
Cocks crowed  fast seriate
Loud shouts of men fast chased after
Scared golden heart quivered
Elsewhere Sở Khanh ushered his ride
Alone fears drowned her mind
Woods trail dropped low soared high scared her
Ruthless is Creator
Why crumpled ailed flower like so
A mob poured in enclosed
Helpless she was constrained wholly
Dame Tú rushed there straightly
Dragged her back angrily den-bound
Without questioning bout
She trampled bloom without mercy
Flesh bones were all earthly
Kiều ached flesh split harshly blood dropped
Shed confess beg to stop
Battered back arched blood-daubed head bowed
To womans fate Im bound
Away from home Im now severed
My life you reign over
Hence Ill take whatever you will
For myself naught I feel
Eels mind not mudded heads
My chasteness shall be shed hereon
Her words Dame Tú pounced on
Confession signed - a bond was sealed
Her bailsman was Mã Kiều
Pained by her harsh ordeals offered
Hag kept reproaching her
Till long long last conferred mercy
To back Kiều was carried
Mã Kiều then discreetly conveyed
All here of Sở Khanhs nature know
Famed cheater of brothels
His hands killed rosemallows branches
Foul play was concocted
By the well-known psychic - witch pair
Thirty taels was his fare
Twas no fluke  this affairs preplanned
He coaxed then off he ran
Beg wisely or you shant be safe
Yet within hes a knave so vile
While she still strained her mind
One brazen mug inside appeared
Heard theres one wench right here somewhere
Accused I had her snared
This face of mine you there you know
Kiều spoke All things settled
Nothing happened its so  nothing
Sở Khanh thundered booming
Strode in raised hand smacking frail soul
Heaven knows shed bellow
Who seduced whom who sold whom out
Pushed me in well profound
Who vowed then swallowed vow promptly
Your faces certain to me to all
Straight claims spread fast through halls
Theyd jeer and mock his fraud his spite
Treason was brought to light
Busted hed opt to hightail then
Alone with her sorrows
She mourned deeply for woeful self
Suffer all must herself the same
Lifes filled with joys and shames
Ones beauty cant remain constant
My past lifes indecent
Vases long been fragmentized
square lifes debts with my body
One clear-Moon night shed see
Dame Tú drop by slowly advise
Efforts this trade requires
All hostesses must strive to learn
Kiều said Rains come gusts turn
This risk I cannot spurn or split
Who will waste cash to sit in here
Therere wonders in our sphere
Nights guests days mates cashier or take
And eight techniques to make guests pleased
Play till guests grow fatigued
Make stones fall hard minds cease to think
At times frown at times wink
To chant Moons verse to sing with blooms
Those crafts our trade subsumes
Master them all round-groomed youll be
Kiều harked brows seemed to squeeze
Turned crescent-shaped face became pale
Such words made Kiều turn ailed
Heartless odd things assailed mans life
Must now learn mystifying trades
Shameless shed be one day
What else was left of fate of hers
Poor soul from home severed
Trapped in hands of strangers was she
Brothel dropped rose drapries
Higher gems worth worthier prize
Theyd dine and laugh through nights months round
Leaves hailed winds twigs hailed fowls
Dawn sent Song Yu dusk found Zhang Qing
Sober once came mornings
Startled she woke ruing her life
Raised in silks draped in blinds
Yet now a crushed bloom by the trail
Face - winds beat mists set - swelled
Frame - bees butterflies felt wholly
Though bedmates were many
To her love was empty unreal
Blooms winds shed oft watch feel
Four sides Moon lit snow filled past shrouds
All scenes were in glooms drowned
When man grieved scenes were bound to grieve
Sketch and verse shed oft weave
By blooms play chess strings tweaked fore Moon
Forced joys would end too soon
Friendless she was in tune with none
Mused hundred thoughts silently slaved
Fragmented thoughts roamed stray
Feelings tangled pains laced throughout
Missed nine labors profound
Mulberries hid sundown each day
Thousands of miles away
Parents knew not ill fate of hers
Naïve brother sister
Whod take her place to serve them now
Mourned transcendental vows
Had he yet heard about her plights
Zhang Tai willow hed find
Yet young sprig was plucked by strangers
Had tree joined with flower thus far
Her hearts skein tangled snarled
Dreamed of homeland afar at night
Round went sunsets arrived set suns
Moons Hare fled Suns Crow spun
Pity the poor soul shunned by Fate
Those born with Heavens grace
In turn were cursed to face ruin
Doomed to fates of dusts winds
Disgraced once first to win mercy
One man midst tourists came
Twas Scholar Thúc first name Kỳ Tâm
Wu Xi Chang Zhou hes from
For fathers shop hed come to stay
Intrigued with Kiềus crowned grace
His rose card found its way toward her
Through veil faced peach flower
All traits were mesmerizing
Like young quinces sprig thriving
Charms bloomed further midst Springs winds rains
Midst Springs night who could rein ones heart
Their souls linked hence theyd start
Knot was tied who could part them now
Dawns till dusks two were bound
From bedmates to propounding troth
For them pure luck was wrought
Thúcs father must head toward hometown
Drowned in passion profound
Through Spring hed oft come round to Kiều
Moon theyd view winds theyd feel
Gods wine filled cups rhymes spieled jointly
Theyd taste dawns scents noons tea
Gos board deemed moves lutes weaved joined tunes
Concord strengthened love soon deepened
How one glance moves nations
Leaves all buildings shaken with ease
Thúc spending as he pleased
Would spend thousands to seize one mirth
Moneys scents made greed surge
Dame Tú groomed Kiềus grace worth further
Night cuckoos hailed summer
Rife pomegranates flowers laced walls
On slow days in her hall
Shed drop rose veil and draw spiced baths
Such pure-white skin she had
Natured forged a fine masterpiece
All curves arches hed see
Hed praise feelings forth weaved Tang rhymes
Your words are gems your lines brocades
Toward home my thoughts have strayed
Your verse Id humbly pay tribute
Yet midst Hangs clouds heart broods
Your verses reply I would owe thee
Such strange words uttered he
Young branchs not of old trees making
Fall-wave eyes dimmed wilting
Her face showed heartrending despair
Youre butterfly that cares for games
Youre married thus youre claimed
Save your breath for day wanes quickly
Since we first met said he
Always my hearts carried firm vows
Till old age well be bound
Hence Ill seek out profound streams source
Countless thanks shed discourse
Yet fallouts shall be brought on all
Your Ping Kang stay youve stalled
For flowers guise youve fallen hard
Then when scents lost guises marred
Will that love stay untarnished so
At cinnamon threshold
Of Moons palace Chang-o presides
Accords knot was long tied
One extra will divide your troth
Dont for clouds weeds which float
Make loves depths ebb and flow for thee
Once Im dead wholl then be decried
If youre a man with might
Protect me from all plights you cant
But if your powers scant
Lions jaws shall dismantle me
Dropped at your wifes mercy
Envy will like flames threefold rage
Above your fathers placed
Down at me will his grace be showed
Or scorn wall-stemmed willows
From brothel to brothel return
Soiled names we will then earn
Mines fine but Im concerned for yours
Find answers - I implore
Me if you do adore then yes
Thúc said You purely guess
Are my feelings as yet unclear
Leave all to me dont fear
Unlike Wu-Laos youre here with me
Entwined always youll see
Swords stones shant part storms we shall brave
Thorough questions theyd trade
By hills seas vows would stay true strong
Night waned yet talks grew long
Moons Hare had hid among west hills
A jaunt was his excuse
To safe house Thúc took Kiều to hide
War scheme peace plot devised
Sought lawmens help had spies stake out
To Dame Tú news came round
Defeated she was bound to cede
Ransom Thúc would bequeath
To court redemption deed hed show
All matters were settled
Fairy was from mortals dirt free
Man and wife joined to be
Love grew like stream long sea profound
Loves incense flames spread out
Pearls sheen lotus hue proudly shone
Six intimate months flew
Wutong yards green boughs fused with gold
Falls mist-white buds bloomed glowed
Thúcs father to his home returned
Like storms thunders wrath burned
Hed split them up concerns laced heart
One harsh rebuke hed start
Fore strict lecture Thúc then
Took risk used heart to wane his rage
know my sins hed state
Thunders axes Ill face gladly
How can my mistakes be undone
Whole day Im her husband
Once married who would sunder tie
If father so decides
Shame of a froward child Ill brave
Steel will could not be swayed
Mad hed kneel fore courts gates to try
Flat grounds were quaked by tides
Red warrant was sent by the court
Theyd follow their escorts
Side-by-side kneel before courts yard
View one steel face like char
Of the judge whod impart harsh cries
That mans led a base life
And that womans a lying fraud
That wasted scent bloom gnawed
Used make-ups to enthrall a fool
Based on complaint I rule
Based on the law Ill show
Two solutions  Your call to make
The laws sanction youll take
Or at brothel retake your place
My minds been made shed say
Spider midst webs shant stay longer
his wife pure or blurred
Though frail and green thunders Ill face
By law punish hed state
Lone peony was caged in woods
Resigned she stilled withstood
Rose cheeks grew pale brows would grimace
She lied midst yard dust-laced
Face - blurred mirror form - wasted bloom
Pity for Thúc - his gloom
Afar he watched consumed by pains
For me youre wronged in vain
If only Id back then complied
Shallow in heart and mind
For whom fore moon and vines youre shamed
The judge heard cries exclaimed
Touched to Thúc he then came to probe
Tear-drenched Thúc promptly told
In full when hed proposed to her
Near far shes considered
From the start shes augured ill fate
Ive caused her current state
Because her trust was placed in me
The judge felt empathy
Hed drop sternness conceive a way
If its true what you say
This harlot knows whats base whats right
Thúc said Through drifting life
Shes humbly learned to write potry
The judge then laughed Really
Your themes The Cangue show me your flair
Shed heed brush raised on air
Her work was brought to where he sat
Prime-Tangs best this surpassed
Thousand gold taels cant match flair grace
No Zhou-Chen couples may outshine
Bear not hate ire in mind
Thwart not concert divine midway
To court youve brought your case
Outsides lawsuit loves placed within
A wife your sons brought in
Banish dissents therein  alls fine
Ordered wedding forthright
Bridal coach dashed flames twined with stars
Two lines of drums flutes marched
For peach shrouds theyd depart with haste
Sir Thúcs ill will and hate thus ceased
Scents of orchids lilies
Filled home where hate once weaved discord
Across dawns wine noons tea
Plums hues waned lotus leaves just grew
One still night in shared room
Fears for shared marriage bloomed  shed say
Since frail willow came stayed
Swifts geese have oft switched place years passed
Homes news youve scarcely had
For mistress youve looked past your wife
Worries in me stirred strife
This news for us wholl hide from her
Of her Ive caught rumors
Adheres to codes speaks words fearsome
fear her depths awesome
Like seabed streams bottom they are
One year has passed thus far
That we cant hide this farthers sure
Till now no newss procured
Or somethings wrong in your household
Back to home you should go
To please her first then know her mind
You put this off our lifes undone
Hed heed her sound reasons
Hed with resolve hardened return
At dawn Thúcs father learned
Of this intent and urged him too
One farewell cup was brewed
From home hed fast head to far land
Bluish Qin river spanned
Sparse willows limbs draped Yang Guans trail
Hands joined they sighed hearts fell
Partings cups stilled words failed smothered
Kiều said Hills streams sever
Inner peaces wrought outer peaces earned
Yếm pin can be discerned
Blindfolded we catch birds in vain
This marriage weve attained
Once home please do explain clearly
In case wild storms stir seas
To her rules Ill gladly abide
Its better than to hide
Which will bring forth great plights later
Love me please remember
Through one long year ever Ill wait
Partings cups mourn this day
Welcoming cups well trade next year
Hed mount his steed and steer
Fall-dyed maple woods smeared far hills
After him red dust filled
Shed spend her lonesome nights
Through thousand miles hed ride alone
In halves the Moon whod torn
Half lit lone bed half shone long roads
Speak not of thoughts on road
But of thoughts first wife showed inside
Of honored Hoạns birthright
Fortunate love he found
Theyd had hair plaitd threads bound for years
Well-mannered she appeared
Reasoning skills were fearsome wise
His new bloom shed descried
From all but him same tidings came
She failed to quell hearts flames
For obscene acts she blamed her spouse
To me had he avowed
That lesser girl Id now condone
For stains of envy wont serve me
Yet this he hid buried
Made childish comedy absurd
Though far of this Ive heard
For your fraud Ive conjured a plan
Fret not shes but an ant
Within the bowl it cant crawl free
Their eye contacts Ill cease
Force her head down so she cant rise
act before their eyes
He sought planks sold boat Ill show him
She kept her thoughts within
Ignored rumors stray winds carried
Next week two men shed see
Theyd brought news to achieve favors
Shed seethe with raw anger
Some rumormongers weaved this lie
She fast displayed her might
Had ones teeth plucked ones vile mouth slapped
Secrets were tightly wrapped
Of rumors none dared blab one sound
Midst rosy walls shed lounge
Shed talk laugh and walk round the same
Nights days hearts scorn inflamed
Back to rose hall Thúc came one night
Words of joy health theyd cry
Passion strengthened and brightly blazed
Dust-cleansing cups theyd trade
Yet their hearts secrets stayed inside
He sought to learn her mind
His own affair hed strive to say
Shed talk laugh drunken swayed
No slightest hints displayed she knew
Vases mouth seems tightly glued
Why confess to her who wont ask
His inner qualms amassed
Would one tugged vine alas shake wood
Midst jokes laughter she would
Insert random inputs inside
Midst pearl-stone gold-brass twined
Your total trust and mine stay true
Praiseworthy are those who
Spread bee-butterfly rumors round
If I let guile confound
A laughingstock no doubt Id be
She spoke with ease calmly
Theyd tease her make-up style
By shared lamp side-by-side view Moon
Homes bliss perch cress staled soon
On gold well wutong swooned sparsely
Sights of far lands hed see
Miss farewell site miss seasons gone
Words of his thoughts yet formed
Of hers she had informed her mate
Whole year white cloud far stays
To Lin Zi you must pay visit
Guts knots those words undid
Hed mount straight toward there flit promptly
Blue sky clear stream copied
Forts soared through mists sunny hills gleamed
Soon as horsewhips noise screamed
For home her carriage steamed as well
All to mother shed tell
Of dark treason bleak felled rapport
If to light envys brought
Itll shame his name distort my own
Ive feigned that Ive not known
Yet my shrewd schemes been sown readied
Lands routes one-month journey
Seas routes straight to Lin Zi shorter
Clear the ship pick servers
Hurt her shame her theyll see theyll jeer
Punish those of such sphere
Make a joke which for years shant fade
Mother praised her fine play
Indulged her gave leeway to act
Hound Hawk picked out a pack of brutes
Theyd sail down wind en-route for Qi
Lonesome by veiled window
Kiềus heart ached with sorrows varied
Are they cold warm rightly cared for
Oaths clipped hairs grown once more
Will Heavens laws maintain this troth
Through ups downs Ive been brought
Should Ive like Chang-o sought lone life
Through sills Falls winds blew by
Half Moon three stars midst sky shimmered
Lit incense fore altar
Her prayer was then muttered halfway
Their swift rise could dismay gods fiends
Yard was lit with blades gleams
Kiều scared by what shed seen grew numb
To sleep drug shed succumb
Comatose shed become shortly
On horses saddle lied she
Theyd set chamber study ablaze
By stream lied one corpse stray
To mislead it was placed inside
Theyd dash for bushes hide midst trees
From close vicinity
Sir Thúc shocked saw the sea of flames
Theyd fight the flares exclaim for aid
By winds the flames were raised
For her theyd search yet theyd find none
Theyd exchange stares look stunned
To well to bush theyd run blindly
In room where once lived she
One charred corpse midst debris theyd spot
Of fraud straight souls knew not
Twas her and no-one thought elseways
Sir Thúcs tears laced his face
Pitied lone son mourned graceful child
At home the corpse arrived
Theyd wrap it up hold rites for her
Service was just over
Thúc arrived soon after on land
Her old chamber he scanned
Walls stood barren soot and chars piled
At mid-house hed stop by
On altar stood inscribed tablet
Alas Hed cry upset
Pains burned entrails grief shreddd his heart
His ceaseless sobs would start
To pure soul fate imparts wrong end
thought wed meet again
Not trade last words that send-offs day
To pains his grief gave way
None could soothe or allay his plights
Hed heard one mystic nigh
Could call spirits grasp high beings
Three Gods Isles Nine Springs
From all realms he could bring back news
Theyd offer him tributes
Have him seek her for clues queries
Before altar bowed he
Incense yet stopped hed freed his soul
He came back clearly told
Shes nowhere yet her storys learned
Much karmas debt shes earned
Shes yet paid off her turns yet come
To woes her sign succumbs
News shall come one year from present
Youll have your reunions
Yet no recognition is shown
Such queer wisdom hed sown
Could they trust words intoned lightly
Twas but faux sorcery
In mortal realm whyd she remain
Hed mourn springs bloom thatd waned
Could fair fairy again be met
Stream flowed bloom dropped  twas set
Or in mortal Hell yet confined
Hound Hawk pulled off foul plot
To their boat Kiều was brought held there
High sails strained cord strong airs
Wu Xi District was their planned stop
At manses hall she was dropped
To the house Hound Hawk offered her
Locked up in maids quarter
Lost still in deep slumber was she
Shed stir from sleep dreamy
Whose strange fort could she be inside
Half-lucid and surprised
Shouts for her presence nigh echoed
One maid urged her to go
Frightened she fast followed the maid
Saw huge forts long hallways
Lord Chancellor so said the sign
Bee-wax candles burned bright
On gem-etched bed sat High Lady
Shed ask detailed queries
Her tale Kiều candidly uttered
Came sudden rain thunder
Lazy licentious curs shed cry
To sins this wenchs inclined
Shes fled from lords or lied to mates
Fields hen tombs cat - this stray
All you are is a graceless lie
To me youve sold your life
And yet you still act high mighty
To my rod you shall see
Let thirty strokes teach thee lesson
Up down choired all servants
One hundred mouths couldnt save her
Flesh all tore up livers grit quailed
Poor lone peach-plum branch ailed
Twas all shredded by hail and squall
Hua-nu she was then called
Assigned as chambers thrall shed be
Midst blue-gown maids toiled she
With skin charred hair snarly shed brave
There lived one aged housemaid
For Kiềus charms grace she gave pity
Shed give her herbs and teas
Offer advice so shed survive
Woe is you shed advise
Willow-frail self should strive for peace
Your karma this must be
Youve fallen for deceit I think
Walls have ears frames have chinks
Ignore others past links also
Should freak thunders rumble
Bees ants for justice howl in vain
Kiềus pearly tears down rained
Heart ached with private pains plenty
Fate of wind-dust ails me
This plight equals twice the old plights
Why too bleak fate of mine
Confines beauties to lives of woes
reap what past life sowed
Blooms may wane pearls crumble Ill brave
Day in day out she slaved
For homes visit Young Lady came
Shed chat much with Madame
Whod later call Kiềus name order
Young Lady needs servers
Go to her manse on her youll wait
Hell or Heaven which place shed be
All day combs cloths readied
A slave to slaves duties was tied
Then came one tranquil night
Daily lutes craft was tried questioned
Shed heed lutes strings were strummed
Divine tunes made heart numb beguiled
Kiềus skills seemed to be prized
Harsh rules were somewhat lightened pared
Shed toil fore foreign stairs
Dusk groan with shades dawn bear hearts pains
Next life may oath again unite
Clouds dyed four sides pure white
Her far homeland where might it be
Days passed months went slowly
Of far-off status she knew naught
Since mandarin ducks fled
For months on his lone bed hed lied
New Moon brought brows to mind
Left rouge scents multiplied his banes
Winter Spring swapped yet pains lingered
Where was erstwhile lover
Hed blame fate to taper mourning
His moods birthed homes yearning
Homesickness urged guiding him there
Grand welcome Hoạn prepared
All news near far theyd share and trade
Chambers blind was high raised
Kiều was called for obeisances rite
Afar shed recognized that face
Thúc sits there at this place no doubt
All secrets now come out
Within a trap Im bound surely
What scheme is this eerie
What mortals this tricky this vile
Shes turned husband and wife
Into master servile worker
Though talks smiles seem chipper
She kills without dagger inside
Now earths low while skys high
How should I act when nigh him now
His sight stirred fears profound
Like silkworm-spun threads bound in knots
Her head bowed as she crossed the yard
Thúcs soul vanished off-guard
Alas Its Kiều hed start Right here
How was she toward here steered
Ive been deceived I fear by lies
Hed say naught seized by frights
Yet fail to stop pearl-like tears leaked
Lady would read him speak
Just home yet what grief streaks your mien
To mothers rites Ive seen
Hoạn praised What piety
Let wine ease all your grieves this day
Wine cups theyd swap and trade
While Kiều held gourds to sate orders
Hoạn eased her then rushed her
Made her kneel to offer him wine
Thúc grew more stupefied
Hed dry his cups entwined with tears
Hed turn laugh without cheer
His wife cried sharply Maid
Make him drink up or face beating
Thúc felt his heart tearing
Drained proffered cups gulping tart tastes
Wine had yet dried shed play new games
This maids skills are vast quaint
Play one tune entertain Master
She grew numb in stupor
Fore screen tuned lute of hers meekly
Four strings moaned sobbed sharply
Caused feasters heart to be shattered
One song her lute conjured
Outward one smiled inner one cried
Tears rained unchecked from eyes
Hed nod his head and wipe dews shed
At her Mistress roared threats
In cheers why strum distressing tunes
Have you no tact buffoon
Youve caused my husbands gloom and pain
More anguish fueled Thúcs banes
Forced talks stiff smiles were feigned swiftly
Dragon clock showed Watch Three
Their faces seemed to please mistress
Within she relished this
Tonights pleasures dismissed aged blues
Thúcs guts shriveled askew
The more he thought more rues hed know
Phoenix-room shared pillow
While lone Kiều faced lamps glows all night
Now all had come to light
Envys bloods bred queer life freakish
Made twains eyes turn path split
Part mandarin kingfisher mates
One bows down low one stays up high
Once its undone what tie still stays
Born to frail beautys fate
Late night thoughts burned echoed
Oils plate waned while tears flowed all night
All day shed serve the manse
Her face Young Lady scanned queried
Shed choose her words wisely
feel for my privy sorrows
To Thúc Mistress would go
Dear please find out her woes for me
Thúcs entrails stung sharply
Neither view nor query felt right
Yet scared hed harm her life
Hed risk asking to pry answers
Kneeling with head lowered
One confession paper shed pen
Fore Mistress it was sent
Shed skim scant conscience then seemed stirred
To Thúc it was conferred
Let flairs be prized dolor be rued
Were her fate well-to-do
A gold manse her values would earn
On beauties lifes tides turned
Such true words Thúc would say
Fine mien bleak fate  The way of life
Hence ease your hands please find mercy
This said spoke Young Lady
She seeks Voids Gates to cease bleak fate
Fine Her wish I shall sate
From woes cycle Ill aid her flight
Hundred-foot figs all vines flowers
Hills pond stretch trees tower
There shell tend there sutra shell chant
Dawn cracked while light was scant
Five gifts scents blooms were granted bought
Fore altar Kiều was brought
Three Vows Five Nays cut off homes ties
Jia-sha replaced blue guise
Trạc Tuyền was her revised cults name
Enough daily oil came
Two maids  Spring Fall  were named shrines aids
Now midst blooms field shed stay
Close to Mauve Grove away from life
Shed not hope for loves ties
No more shamed rouge sufficed nicely
Days wrote sutras nights she lit scents
Drops from willows branch cleansed
Hearts flames earthly intents away
Since she saw Buddhas way
Falls Moon at times had stayed atop
Locked room was watched nonstop
Shed speak at meets yet sob alone
Shrine and study were close
Yet distant as tenfold streams hills
Thúcs sighs and groans were stilled
Hed do nothing until one day
For home Hoạn made her way
Thúc crossed the yard ran straight for Kiều
In tears pains were revealed
Blue collars soaked with spilling tears
Yet blooms alone right here tortured
By womans scheme conquered
Though pained for you utter I cant
Your woes from me began
Green Springs lost pearls by sand dirtied
risk my life to be with you
But an heirs yet produced
clench my teeth undo vowed troth
Shame Ive stained bronze smashed stone
Hundred lives cant atone for sins
Kiều Round lone boat swirls spin
Float or sink it lies in fates hand
Strange how till now I can survive
Raindrop falls where it might
Let people feast their eyes on this
A shame how lute strings fit
Troth lasts one day yet its still troth
Please think have exit wrought
Deep love debt such acts fraught with both
Thúc Private thoughts Ive sowed
Mortal hearts are unknowable
Should later come rains squalls
Both you and I shall all suffer
To flee you should venture
For you my loves severed from here
To different paths were steered
Whenll lost pledge be cohered again
Streams may dry rocks may wane
Silkworm till death still strains spins threads
Tales old new were expressed
Theyd talk and talk incessantly
Eyes hands were locked tightly
Came sounds of maids entry afar
With grief swallowed theyd part
Sweetly shed smile utter
From whence did you saunter my dear
Thúc From bloom viewing near
came to watch nun here pen scripts
Such fine longhand shed quip
Orchid Pavilion writs equal
Such skills a thousand golds worthwhile
Temples red tea theyd dry
To study heels aligned returned
Kiều grew more shamed concerned
To her maid shed then turn whisper
Mistress came maid answered
And spent half an hour on toes
Smallest details she knows
All words shes heard thoroughly learned
Woes thoughts Mistress discerned
Masters pained tears concerns youd moaned
Aside I stood as told
Hearing enough she strolled upstairs
Such words gave Kiều much scare
Such a woman is rare peerless
What talents What boldness
Thoughts of her stir numbness terror
At lifes moves shes clever
Even Thúc yields to her hands tied
Affairs proofs shes descried
Envys blood makes all lives snarl frown
Yet cries were stilled and drowned
Shed talk and greet around kindly
Mundane is shown frenzy
Yet smiling in fury  thats sly
must fear for my life
Beasts fangs snakes venom bind me now
With wings Id soar unbound
For hands shall soon pluck flower high
Fated to drift for life always
Bare hands cant simply make warmth food
In the shrine thoughts ensued
Treasures of high value shed see
For subsistence shed seize
Drums sounds of late Watch Three echoed
Shed climb past bloom-filled wall
Toward dim moonbeams shed go westbound
Nights trees sand dunes hills stretched
Cocks crowed on fogged bridge etched shoes marks
Lone girl trekked through the dark
Long road scared her plight sparked pity
Dawn shone on mulberries
Where was shelter This shed not know
Far temple shed behold
Seclusions Call Shrine shown clearly
Kiều tapped its gates firmly
The shrines nun heard quickly took in
Saw dark brown garb within grace thrived
Young nuns from Peking hailed
Heed mentor Buddhas trail orders
Mentor wholl come later
Had me bring these treasures to you
Gold bell silver gong too
In person offered two treasures
Prioress checked uttered
If Hằng Thủys your mentor were friends
Alone youve passed through lands
Wait few days for your mentor here
Shed rest in cloud-bound sphere
Eat salt pickles appear carefree
Sutras shed learned wholly
Got used to lamps study incense
Palm tomes raised flag shed tend
Night came light lamps dawn came sound bells
Prioress respect swelled
Blooms shades draped earth midst sky Moon lit
Clear clouds calm winds - placid
One devotee visitd the shrine
The bell and gong he eyed
Lady Hoạns are much like those two
Late night she then reviewed Kiềus tale
Secrets could not stay veiled
Kiều told her lifes details wholly
Toward here fate has thrust me
Frail lifes doomed or lucky you will
Giác Duyên listened grew still
Compassion terror filled her mind
Soft counsels shed confide
To all Buddhas gates wide open
Your life such incidents will mar
You should first hide run far
Dont wait for flood to start to rise
There lived Bạc clan nearby
Who oft offered the shrine tributes
To accept Kiềus refuge for now
Thinking haven was found
Kiều swiftly left without foresight
Yet they were hypocrites
Dames Bạc Tú worked same lines of trade
She saw Kiềus charms and grace
Thrilled to gain goods thatd pay richly
At once anxieties seized her
Rebuffs were cried harder
Shed shout harsh threats order union
Your bad names crossed distance far near
Youll bring ruins I fear
To shelter you who here will try
Nuptial home you should find
Or take refuge in high Heaven
Afar no ones present around
Is my nephew not outsider
A Tai Zhou store owner
Hes straight candid never tells lies
Listen to words of mine
Head there become his wife you should
None would know you none would
Midst vast seas long streams youd be free
Grave aftermath youll see later
Shed knit her brows glower
The more she heard stronger woes grew
Homeless and strayed  Kiều knew
Twas her dead end out flew clamors
Swallows from flock severed
Once shot its scared of curved twigs now
Though troths my sole way out
Faces known yet hearts enshrouded veiled
By chance should woes assail
Caught by flesh traders ailed Ill be
If Im to be married
Let him pledge honestly his vow
By Heaven Earth its bound
then cross seas profound gladly
Bạc left once shed agreed
Informed her clan readied wedding
The clan cleaned up bustling
Yard swept shrine set jars rinsed scents lit
Hed boast and have gods witness vow
Midst yard hed pledged aloud
Red-thread rite behind shrouds was done
To boat led her husband
To Tai Zhou boat quickened downwind
At port hed fast begin
To leave first for routine venue
Twas an old lodge he knew
Flesh traders through and through likewise
Theyd checked and set a price
Sold goods was worth ten times expense
A coach for her hed rent
Bạc grabbed his cash and went his way
At flowered porch coach stayed
Before altar stood she
Same white-browed god shed see  brothel
With one swift glance shed know
Caged bird could not circle high sky
Curse this bound fate of mine
Once loosened knots now tied once more
My own life I deplore
Why born gifted to score Fates spite
Waters once purified
Yet times again mud grimes water
Much pain its spun never stopping
Since I strayed from home kin
Ive risked this life risking always
What sins has this youth made
Half Spring lost still Im braving woes
Fates rule I must follow
risk my youth forego my prime
Falls wind was cool Moon clear
One client from frontier came round
With broad shoulders build stout
Tiger-beard silkworm-brows swift-chin
Heros aura out streamed
An apt fighter esteemed stratgist
To no-one hed submit
Hed roamed freely through life
Sword lute and oar sufficed his needs
Hed learned of Kiềus prestige
His respect for her eased strong will
When brought to rosy guild
Theyd share a glance hearts filled with zest
Lets speak with hearts Từ stressed
For I dont fickly mess around
Ive heard of grace renown
Worthy man youve yet found have you
Heroes in life are few
With jailed fish caged bird whod bother
Youre too kind Kiều answered
Choose stone test golds essence
To whom my hearts credence should go
must please guests to fro
Thus cannot pick true gold from brass
Such heartfelt words dear lass
Recall Lord Ping Yuans past verse lines
See any parts of mine you trust
Dragon-cloud Jin Yang must soon see
You praise weed bloom paltry
My stray lifes not worthy of you
Hed nod pleased through and through
Laugh Soulmates are hard to come by
Hero midst dusty sights you see
With one word you know me
Boundless wealth and glory well share
Hearts harmonized then there
Love formed no pledge the pair uttered
Hed inform matchmaker
Kiềus bought price hed cover squarely
Build manse chamber privy
Set gemmed bed eight-fairy curtain
Hero beauty were one
Phoenix pair matched dragon theyd ride
Six months loves hearth burned high
He longed to roam four skies swiftly
With one sword lone horse he ran straight
Wives follow husbands ways
To where you go shed state Ill go
Từ spoke Our hearts we know
Why keep common girls codes till now
Once skilled army is found
Rallies shake earth flags shroud all roads
Once superb names well-known
welcome you back home that day
Right now theres no fixed place
Youll hinder me when ways yet clear
Rather you wait right here
At most Ill take one year only
Words ceased horse left promptly
Pengs wings sailed winds to see far miles
Alone shed stay behind
Lock chambers doors through nights endless
Moss-filled yard whod visit
Grass thrived willows - a bit - thinned waned
On far-off home eyes trained
Yearning tailed Jin clouds lane distant
She ached for aged parents
Had their longing torments yet ceased
Ten years plus passed swiftly
Rough-skinned mist-haired theyd be if live
Shed mourn old pledge contrived
Hearts threads still clung though mind had quit
Now theyd have lots of kids - maybe
Drifter missed home country
Stray thoughts crisscrossed every which way
Swans wings soared faraway
On distant skies drained gaze focused
Days nights shed wait anxious
Nearby wars pernicious flames raged
Soldiers armors arms raided roads
Neighbors gave her counsels
To find shelter lie low for now
She said By oath Im bound
Though dangers nigh I shall not flee
She lingered skeptically
Rallys cries flags shed see outside
Chorused Whos the Lords wife Please show
Theyd take off arms bow low fore her
With fair courts maids servers
Well bring you home ordered the Lord
Phoenix carriage shed board
Don lustrous crown sun-colored clothes
Theyd sound drums with flags closed
Flutes lutes preceded gold carriage
South-Court Camps assemblage drums noised
Bastions guns roared flags hoistd
Lord Từ himself deployed to hail
Known face strange gauze cap belt
Same swift-chin silkworm male eyebrows
Hed laugh Fish stream are bound
My past words do you now recall
Hero fathoms hero
Are you content with all you see
Though young and frail said she
Blessed vine can count on trees great shades
Though your fruits I now face
My hearts been sure since day one two
Eyes met laughter broke through
Theyd go to shared room to confide
Throw feast for troops as prize
War drums martial tunes piped shrilly
Wealth cleansed past miseries
Fresher their love would be each day
While feast was joyous gay
Shed narrate drifting days calmly
Of Wu Xi of Lin Zi
Of fraud and anguish shed gone through
Though Im now free from blues
Lord Từ listened to her
Displeased hed show thunderous rage
Steel troops pick men posthaste
Order men to migrate promptly
Wave red flags split army
Two for Wu Xi Lin Zi left straight
For those whod wronged her fate
Theyd search names take away question
Sent heralds with pennants
To house-arrest sentenced Thúc Tribe
Theyd send summons invite
Old maid Giác Duyên as high callers
All was told to soldiers
Solemnity anger all showed
Heavens vengeance was known
Theyd net all in one go cleanly
At camp stood armed soldiers
Inner troops queued outer formed lines
Cannons banners would hide the floor
Midst camp on seats for Lords
Sat Từ his wife before soldiers
By camps gate prisoners were named
Từ spoke All debts all shames
Are yours to judge to blame clearly
Please repay those worthy shed state
Repay then vindicate
Thats up to you Từ said to try
Swords tip to Thúc would fly
Pale-faced hed - like a snipe - shake wilt
Debt weighs like thousand hills
Lin Zis old mate you still recall
Apart - I failed wifes role
Whose fault Still I shant fault old mate
Small thanks debts Ill repay
Thousand silver brocades hundred
Your wifes wily wicked
Now thief old ladys hit upon
Ants crawled bowls rim not long
Foul schemes favors hereon repaid
Poor Thúc seemed ill afraid
Sweats like rain soaked his face body
Heart was torn by fright glee
Scared for his wife happy for her
Old maid nun came after
To high seats Kiều ushered promptly
Hands held face shown said she
When stray soul was dethroned
Gold hills cant repay shown kindness
Thousand gold small largess
No gold weight can tie with kind souls
Bewilderment theyd show
Both fear and joy were sowed inside
Please stay sit for a while
Look closely witness my vengeance
Brought were captives present
Whod wait to be questioned by her
Unsheathed sword midst banners
Named Lady Hoạn major felon
Kiều fast showed reception
Here Young Ladys present lastly
Few women rival thee
Such face heart historys seen few
The fouler the more rueful pained
Hoạns soul was banished drained
Head kissed the earth mouth strained weaved pleas
A womans hearts in me
Think of sutras temple
Of why no-one followed past flight
Much pain Ive brought about
May sea-wide heart allow mercy
My compliments said she
Such words are praiseworthy and wise
Youre blessed if I dont try
If I do petty Ill be then
Its good that you repent
Kiều ordered guards free went the wife
She bowed midst court obliged
From gate guards dragged a line of men
By vast Heaven cried then
Who hurts others shall end up hurt
Near stood Hound Hawk perverse Sở Khanh
Dame Tú Mã the Scholar
those crooks deserve her mercy
Based on what vows theyd weaved
Ordered guards would carry them out
Flesh shattered blood dropped down
No witness was without terror
Who wrongs others others will wrong
Those whose vice crafts burn strong
Reap whats sowed for pleas throngs shant feel
Troops crowded trial field
In broad daylight all steeled witnessed
Once vengeance was finished
Giác Duyên fast spoke her wish to leave
Kiều said Rare chances perceived
Old friends meetings conceived seldom
Apart clouds weeds shall come
To where clouds herons from here stray
Not for long nun would say
To far land I wandered
Nun Tam Hợp - a seer - I faced
Reunions times she said
This year next half decade wed meet
Hence future sight Ill heed fully
Fortune binds you and me
Our chances are many - why rush
Tam Hợps prophecy must be true
Meet her once more should you
Of my ending please do query
Shed bid adieu swiftly set out
Since rights wrongs were quelled now
Inner woes tides - she found - decreased
Before Lord Từ kneeled she
never thought Id see this day
By thunder you relay
My hearts rid of huge weights inside
Debts in bones guts inscribed
Which even when I die shant fade
Chose soulmates in one day like so
Those with heros titles
On roads act when troubles occur
This is households matter
With thanks whyd you bother regard
In Jin In Yue - you are severed
Till one house all gather
Once they see you flattered Ill be
Troops banquet was readied
Countless soldiers would see wrongs cleansed
Army morale soared high
Whole nation knew their might power
Their court ruled one corner
Half the state fell under its reign
At times strong as storms rains
Five Souths districts theyd gained control
Midst dust-wind one honed sword
Scorned whod eat dress and know no pains
Where many suzerains hed raised
His banners none would face
Five years hes ruled this places shores lands
Came one trusted states man
He by the Kings dictate
At will led troops to slay rebels
Knew Từ as great hero
Knew Kiều discussed martial matters
Hed still troops send treasures to bribe
Kiềus own tributes came by
Thousand-pound gems two fine courts maids
At camp news was relayed
Lord Từs own mind was vague torn still
This reign my own hands built
Chus seas Wus streams at will Ive roamed
If I bowed to Mings rule
As shamed subject how would fate be
Robes codes would confine me
Grand titles would prove meaningless
While with free reign like this
This might who dares dismiss defy
At will stir seas pierce sky
No mans within this life higher
By sound words rich treasures was swayed
Much anguishs cursed frail fate of mine
With a Kings vassals life
Blue clouds pathway is wide open
A trip home - Ill plan one later
As crown statesmans partner
gain esteem honored theyll be
For the state then famly
Duty and fealty achieved
Better than boat midst stream
Exposed to all extreme currents
In time of discussion
Shed seize her chance balance cons pros
Much kindness Highness shows
Its sprayed widespread and sowed deeply
His graces brought long-lived peace
The people are greatly grateful
If you wage wars struggles
Wu Dings bone heap will grow head-high
Your name shall be defiled
Thousand years Huang Chaos life whos praised
Rather fortune high place
To eminence that ways certain
Từ saw her words reason
Offense to submission agreed
To disarm disband hed announce
Ignored martial actions
Were confirmed by agents as true
Such chance Lord Hồ fast used
With rites hed hid ambush preplanned
Peace signed flags first advanced
Rites wares moved up bronze cannons hid
Obtuse Từ knew not this
Toward gate in rites outfit hed go
Guns roared three sides flags rose four sides
Caught by sudden surprise
Helpless would sacred tigers be
Till death hed fight not flee
Commanders bravery hed show
For Heaven left his soul
Tall he stood midst circles of men
Firm as stone and bronze then
He could not be moved when shaken
Troops would massacre hunt
Deaths air thundered and stunned all lives
Ramparts bunkers were wiped
To there Kiều was led by wild troops
Midst arrows stone shots loops
Từ beneath vast skies stood firmly
Wits might you had plenty
This ends because of me my view
Howll disgraced me see you
Rather this day I too perish
Her tears rained down sadness
Shed still near him shed dip her head
Grudges auras would wed
Từ fell as her head met the ground
Soldiers who stood around
Pitied her pulled her out slowly
To camp she was carried
Lord Hồ saw tenderly conveyed
A beauty of ill fate
Caught in wars throes dismays - Pity
Courts schemes reaped victory
Yet your words helped achieve this gain
Objectives been attained
What favors youll obtain as prize
Harder gushed tears pearl-like
Slowly shed vocalize hearts woes
Từ was a great hero
Across skies seas he roamed freely
Due to his trust in me
Though peerless he agreed to yield
We thought fame wealth wed wield
Not sudden death midst field of war
Five years freely he soared
Yet hollow death was scored for naught
Feats - you said - my words wrought
Yet listed feats just brought more grief
Ive caused more sins than feats
From worthless life relief I crave
Please grant a shallow grave
For august man to stay buried
Lord Hồ showed some pity
By river Từs body was laid
Troops feast revered triumph
Forced Kiều by blinds served food
Like mournful rains typhoons
Fingertips blood had strewn four strings
Trumped cicadas apes sings
Hồ listened tears dripping and frowned
From where is this tune found
Countless torments such sound conveys
Kiều spoke Its called Bleak Fate
myself wrote in days of old
While young this I composed
And now bleak fate unfolds in life
Sounds sight bewitched ears eyes
Steel face was softened by passion
Ties of wife and husband
Snapped lutes strings whod fasten for thee
an outcast said she
Spouses unjust deaths on me this day
Withered bloom has no place
Spared by your compassion
Homes sights a good fortune to me
Too drunk wasted was he
As states core official
Above outside eyes pored over
Not some wanton player
Howd he solve this matter soundly
Day lit his agency
On one scheme hed firmly decide
Lords words whod dare defy
Forced Kiều must wed a tribes statesman
Old Thread Weavers irksome
Random red threads are spun rashly
Coach made for boat straightly
Lamps lit up draperies dropped down
Peach hues paled sad brows frowned
Her whole being was drowned in woes
Cheat folks favors forego bright life
In death wherell bones of mine go to
Oh bound red thread who slew
Oh debts who forced into my hands
Here how did my life land
What days I have left shant bear worth
Living is without mirth
Then let my life to earth return
Alone much grief Ive learned
Let gem be smashed gold spurned shattered
Alone shed stand lower - shaky
Twas Qian Tang river - she was told
Shed recall dreams of old
Đạm Tiên youre there old friend
Receive me as vowed then down there
Shed compose by lamps flare
One last poem as farewell note
Spread gemmed veils on the boat
Lord Từ showed vast kindness
failed his trust for this states sake
Killed spouse new mate Ill take
Can such disgrace partake in life
Entrust my heart to sky river
She viewed the vast water
Then threw herself under strong flows
Though statesman fast followed
Gem scents had been swallowed wholly
Pity ones destiny
Gifted talents beauty cursed life
Shed known woes of exile
Whatd she have left once plights had ceased
Fifteen years woes plenty
For girls examples she had set
What a tragic kismet
Once yin peaks yang offsets - who knows
Those whose loyaltys shown
Whyd Heaven long set woes on them
Shed held her gourd always journeyed
Priestess Tam Hợp shed see
Of Kiều she thoroughly questioned
One with faith compassion
Whys she plagued by torments and plights
Though weal woes Fate decides
From mans hearts she replied All start
Fate rules so do mans hearts
Prudences bliss love imparts hazards
Though Thúy Kiềus fine clever
As all rose cheeks suffers bleak fate
Strong passion in her stays
To which she obligates herself
In weal shell not long dwell
Harmony will be felled shattered
Phantoms demons guide her
Shell tread paths of adversity
Shell face catastrophes
Twice in brothels twice shes a maid
Midst swords unsheathed spears raised
Among wild beasts no places settled
Midst turbulent rough flows
Fore dragons jaws shell throw herself
Woes follow passion well
Life Death are harsh undone
Alas Whats left but naught in life
Priestess spoke Itll be fine
Merits will rectify karma
Thúy Kiềus sins debts thus far
Shes trapped in love unmarred by lust
Paid deep debts with thoughts just
She sold herself faiths touched Heaven
She kills one saves thousands
Knows right from wrong decent from base
Such merits none equate
Pasts sins are thus erased cleanly
Good souls Heaven shall please
Miss your old friend should you
Then sail down Qian Tang to fetch her
You should fulfill your words
Both Heavens your favor itll be
Giác Duyên listened seemed pleased
By Qian Tangs seashore she then stayed
Built grass-house roof thatch-laced
Blue sea gold clouds her place observed
Two enlisted anglers
Built boat made nets for a years pay
No strains made set heart sway
What luck By stroke of Fate theyd meet
Since Kiều jumped in flows fleet
Sudden flows would soon lead her there
By thrown net Kiều was spared
Visions which Tam Hợp shared were true
On the boat silk robe strewed
Though drenched like glass faces hue was bright
Was still deeply wrapped by slumber
In dream pure soul wandered
Đạm Tiên from days older appeared
Ive long waited right here
Spent more than ten long years for thee
Hearts kind yet fates dreary
Doomed yet heart shows unequalled shine
Heavens seen heart pure-white
Sold self - faithful saved lives  humane
For nations peoples gain
Merits scale wins against bleak fates
From Dooms Scroll names erased
And your poems Ill place with you
Much pleasure will ensue
Old troths fulfilled bliss too prospers
Still caught within wonders
Trạc Tuyền she heard hollered by ear
Her dream fast disappeared
Confused who did she hear just now
On boat Giác Duyên perched down nearby
Her sight brought much delight
With boat tied theyd stop by grass-house
Share home day in day out
Eat salt pickles view cloud Moon breeze
Four sides filled with vast scenes
Tides rose all day clouds seized all space
Pasts woes were cleansed effaced
Pasts troth would at this place she find
While Kiều braved tragedies
Six months passed home hed go back to
Where sceneries seemed to have changed
Midst yard weeds thrived reeds waned
Windows unveiled walls rain-beaten
The site seemed abandoned
Last years peach blooms vibrant midst breeze
Swallows circled lowly
Grass filled soils moss buried shoes prints
Back walls filled with thorns splints
Along these paths theyd been last year
Twas still as a shrine here
His hearts feelings whod hear them now
A neighbor came around
Kim asked questions found out events
Of Vương to court he went
Of home twas somewhere else
Hed ask of Quan as well as Vân
Sewed clothes wrote scrolls to earn their keeps
At once his life force seeped outside
For new address hed pry
Hed swiftly leave to find their place
Grass-house mud-walls decayed
Sparse bamboo door with frayed blinds rods
Yards drenched grass filled earth sod
Both dread and awe then caught his mind
Hed shout out from outside
Quan swiftly at his cry ran out
Led Kim into the house
From the back the Vương spouses came
Theyd moan as sobs wrecked frames
Have you heard what became of us
Kiềus fate is tenuous
Alas She failed your trust and vow
Households mishap came round
She sold herself bailed out father
Countless woes followed her
Many times she uttered her will
Shared oaths effective still
Her place Thúy Vân will fill for her
Your kindness she answered
Deep pains in lives later shell hold
This life love has failed troth
After Hell reborn soul shall pay
These firm words she relayed
When she left shed engraved inside
Bleak is my daughters life
Wherell you stray while Kims right here now
Voiced woes grew more profound
As he listened pains sprouted more
Sobs wrecked frame tears outpoured
Tears cascaded gloom tore numb soul
Hed cry hed faint in throes
Pains of rift were acute
Unsurely old Vương soothed consoled
Bleak fate cant fulfill troths youve shared
Though pained for one out there
Show priceless self some care wont you
Hundred comforts out flew
Yet flames of sorrows grew only
Gold bracelets of pledge weaved
With old lute incense hed left her
Guts throbbed in grief anger profound
Its because I walked out
Made blooms drift weeds stray now cried he
Countless vows we have weaved
Stone vows bronze oaths conceived where now
Beds unshared still espoused
My heart cant split whats bound our lives
Costs time mean naught Ill find my mate
His love no words could say
With tearful words away hed go
Fast fix house patio
Invite the aged couple to stay
In duty hed engage
Care for parents in place of hers
Grind tear-mixed ink write words
Send agents have letters relayed
Hed spend much cash for aids
To Lin Qing - back forth - theyd journey
Theyd spread out ask queries
Midst vast skies seas whered she reside
Yearnings intensified
Flames burned steel guts pains sliced gold heart
Silkworms belly grew starved
Cicadas frame chill-marred soon waned
Hed wake then faint again
Blood spilled with tears dreams reined his soul
Much dread parents would show
They feared that he would go too far
Weddings plans theyd fast start
Vân would soon tie her heart with his
One with grace one with wits
Skilled lad fair lass in bliss tied knots
To home a wife hed brought
Yet sorrows joy could not erase
Through their conjugal days
His love both new and aged deepened
When would old love lessen
Hearts skeins twisted torrents tears poured
Hed light scents lute of yore hed play
Strings sounds wailed in dismay
Fragrant smoke rose wind swayed the blinds
Near terrace on roof high
Gowns shade flitted voice nigh echoed
Heart was etched with vows old
Her thoughts made him behold her sight
Nights days were fraught with plights
Springs Falls had passed come by again
A test the King arranged
In one day Quan Kim gained honors
Skys Gates Clouds Path offered
Courts blooms welcomed motherland praised
Past deeds Quans mind replayed
Hed see old Chung repay old debt
Shown kindness was offset
Two clans grew closer wedlock tied
Since Kim flourished in life
His thoughts of her had heightened woes
Whod pledged vows of jade gold
Gold Gates Jade Dorm hed show to whom
Duckweeds waves swept consumed
Hed thrived yet mourned one doomed to stray
Hed bring wife kids obey decree
His new post was easy
Days nights cranes lutes sounds weaved delight
Midst chambers peach-hued blinds
Vân slept and dreamed of sight of her
To him shed then whisper
Faith and distrust severed his mind
One change of sound devised error
Yet bound were soul-sisters
Perhaps good news answers lied here
In court hed ask far near
Đô - an old clerk - came near answered
This ten-year case occurred
Name face I know for sure truly
From Peiking they retrieved one lass
Lutes skills rhymes flair she had
Thúy Kiềus grace charms surpassed all souls
Stubborn virgin was bold
Mortal shames cursed frail life
With Thúcs her loves threads twined later
Yet first wife was bitter
To Wu Xi they took her dealt pains
She escaped from their reins
Met Bạc clan once again woes struck
Bought then sold what poor luck
Clouds adrift weeds unstuck would stray
Yet one person shed face
With matchless might-wits stateliness
With skilled soldiers countless
Lin Zi was seized by his order
All rights wrongs shed answer
Repay kindness tortures squarely
With fairness piety
She squared debts gained glory far near
Name - I know not I fear
From Scholar Thúc youll hear wholly
Đôs words showed clarity
One letter to Thúc he fast wrote
Of her status hed probe
Of her spouse kids hed note their names
Thúc When crisis inflamed
At camp I asked and came to know
The lord Từ Hải once showed
Flair and grace  no wonder theyd wed
For years he roamed far fled
Made Heaven Earth upset quiver
East lands troops took over
Yet I know not later accounts
Kim harked detailed recounts
Inner daze numbness bound his heart
Pity lone leaf apart
Whend it be cleansed discard caught dust
Flower flowed with streams rush
Mourned afloat fate rued crushed old ties
Though vows were left behind
Both incense and lutes sight were here
Lutes strings produced sounds queer
Would their love persevere this life
Duckweed strayed in exile
Howd he in weal sit by calmly
Seal post he longed to cede
Through countless streams vales he would pass
Hed brave swords spears en masse
Risk his life to at last see her
Birds shade fishs sight - wherver to find
For news hed wait stand by
Rains shines swapped countless times over
Came five-hued cloud paper
His Highness clear order arrived
Nan Ping - Kim was assigned
Fu Yang was Quans prescribed office
They fast prepared carriage
Theyd share one route and heed high rule
Hear rebels reign fell through
Fu Jian and Zhe Jiang too settled
Kim asked Quan to follow
For her along the road theyd scout
To Hang Zhou they came round
Theyd gain detailed accounts right there
On day of fierce warfare
Afield Từ to ploys snare succumbed
Was forced to wed statesman local
Jade was cast midst streams flows
Such grace Qian Tang swallowed formed grave
Split took reunions place
Whole clan thrived while she faced wronged end
They set tablet called soul
Set altar to cleanse woes by tides
Tides like white hills aligned
They thought they saw roses sight fall down
Deep bond viewed sea profound
Where was Jing Weis soul now bound for
What luck fate had in store
From elsewhere Giác Duyên fore them came
Eyes caught blessed tablets name
Who are you shed exclaim startled
Kinfolks from her household
She lives why do you mourn one live
News left them stunned surprised
Here are parents husband
Here are siblings heres an in-law
Nun said Fate bound me her
Lin Zi at first later Qian Tang
When she into stream sprang
fetched her back to land brought her
At shrine we took shelter
Grass-temple is neighboring near
Though shrines lifes peaceful here
Homesickness domineers her mind
News filled all with delight
What pleasure could outshine this glee
Since leaf was from woods cleaved
Theyd risked a lot to seize her news
Blooms waned scents fled  theyd mused
Next life theyd see one whod perished
Thought life death had caused split
Now the live dead met midst lifes sphere
After her theyd then steer promptly
Theyd march cross grass split reeds
Though profound love conceived some doubts
By shore they walked around
They passed tall reeds and found the shrine
Shed swiftly step outside as told
Her whole clan shed behold
Both parents were though old healthy
Both grown siblings shed see
Along with Kim from the old days
Was it present time place
Wide-eyed she thought shed faced a dream
Tears soaked robes bib agleam
Joy mixed with grief thoughts streamed inside
In mothers lap shed dive
Full tale was told midst cries and moans
By waves weed was far thrown
Fifteen years had since flown right by
Thought stream had claimed my life
doubted in this life wed meet
Two folks held hands took heed
Mien was - since she took leave - the same
Rains shines had Moon bloom maimed
Some of prime youth was claimed wasted
Joy could not be weighted
Greetings tales were cited briskly
Siblings fully queried
This sight made Kim feel glee shed woes
Fore shrines steps theyd bow low
Both her rebirth grace shown theyd praise
Carriage was brought with haste
Old Vương told her to stay with them
Kiều spoke Plucked blooms lithesome
Half of my lifes succumbed to pains
On stream across skys range
Whod have thought Id attain this day
Reborn loved ones Ive faced
My hearts long yearnings sated filled
at this shrine at will
This age grass trees fulfill finely
Pickles and salt suit me
Monk robes hue I appreciate
care not earthly states
Whyd I to realm dust-laced return
Whatll halfway effort earn
Abstinence I shall learn for life
cant leave her behind and go
Ways of abstinence show change too
Worship Buddha should you
Then obligations wholl cover
Great lifes debt is honored
Well build temple bring her home too
His words shed adhere to
Bid nun and scenes adieu then go
Back at Quans office post
Reunions feast the whole clan threw
Slight tipsiness ensued
Two souls met exchanged vows of troth
By mishap split was wrought
Hence younger sister caught pledged tie
Iron magnet are twined
Blood flows entrails inside soften
Long-kept aspirations
Fifteen-year affections are rife
Broken glasss now revived
Heavens predestined prizes attained
Love lives and lovers gained
Old Moon shines oaths retained always
Peachs green - fast formulate marriage
At once Kiều fast dismissed
On old tales why insist till now
Though we did speak such vows
Winds rains have worn me out amply
More shame such talks conceive
Rather let tides recede wash all
Kim spoke Such words birth awe
Hearts set yet what of old past oath
We pledged that solemn troth
Thick Earth high Heaven both witnessed
Though things alter stars shift
Through Life and Death promise must stay
Why would you bifurcate shared tie
Husband wife harmonize
She said Such love all strive to gain
think in weddings chain
Virginitys priceless
Or nuptial lamps transmit great shame
Since mishaps to me came
Bees butterflies have claimed pure soul
Rough squalls rains took their toll
All Moons lose roundness grown blooms fade
Whats left of a spoilt grace
seek naught now my days are through
With self Im ashamed too
Dare not force filth into wifes role
Of your deep love I know
Yet nuptial lamps sights show me shame
In sealed chamber hearts tamed
Though not a monk Ive claimed ones life
Though love still weighs your mind
Instead of spouse be my dear friend
My lifell be soiled woes will haunt me
But in truth there must be two sides
Since old in womens lives
Chastenesss diversified differed
At times normal altered
In changed times why concur with norms
Chasteness your dutys formed
What dust can smudge deform prized frame
By Heaven this day came
Fog dispersed clouds - the same - scattered
Waned bloom seems much fresher
Ten full Moons waned shimmer outshines
What doubts still vex your mind
Why make me turn my eyes from you
She heard his heartfelt views
With which her parents too concurred
With reasons drained from her
Shed sigh with head lowered and moan
Reunions feast theyd thrown
Candles lit blooms red glowed midst shrouds
Face-to-face spouses bowed
All rites were set two spouses joined
Nuptial cups were enjoyed
Hearts rued old love new joint dazed minds
Since lotus shot peach thrived
Fifteen years had gone by till now
Love split joint - all around
Woes joys were shared throughout long night
Midst brocade veils theyd lie
Rose cheeks beneath lamplight glimmered
Old bee bloom together once more
She said My lifes deplored
Its worthless to yearn for spoilt frame
For love whichs stayed the same
Adhering I became your mate
Much shame in my heart stays
My thickened brazen faces ugly
If loves outward only
At faces Im worthy to gaze
If youre too intimate
Covet earths scents pluck aged flowers
Should impure acts occur
Love will shift to rancor promptly
Loves like treason only tenfold
For lineage of household
My dear sister will hold my place
Chasteness though scant still stays
safeguard it not waste remnants
There remain deep passions
Why pick a bloom shrunken to view
He said I pledged with you
For naught fish bird are through severed
mourned one whod wandered
Mourned solemn oath suffered deep woes
For love all lengths Id go
United loves still whole complete
Mid-spring willows still green
From loves cycle youd weaned  I thought
Lifes dust clear glasss not caught
To me your resolve brought more awe
Ive sought pin midst seas floor
Urged by firm oath not for lust gain
Now together again
Though birds bees are abstained were mates
Clothes pin fixed shed prostrate
Thick Earth high Sky shed praise honor
Soiled frames been cleansed filtered
Thanks to straight heart greater than all
Thats true empathy for ones heart
This night honor shant part with me
Hand then held hand swiftly
For love faith love increased further
Theyd add scents light tapers
Share wine with each other in glee
Memories gushed freely
By fates rule she answered
By wrongs Ive been bothered till now
Regret cant turn things round
Out of respect I shall comply
On strings fey hands would glide
With incense tunes would rise echo
Butterfly or Zhuang Zhou twas which
Youth-mourning tunes were rich
King Shus soul or rails pitch - which say
Clear as pearls in Moons bay
Warm as Lan Tians just-made jewlry
Five tones ears heard wholly
Doles and joys notes conceived conveyed
Twas once tragic now gay it sounds
Are joys blues to heart bound
Or cause woes end thus now comes glee
Its my small gift said she
Woeful sounds long trapped me in pains
Long has cognation reigned
From here never again Ill play
All thoughts theyd yet conveyed
Roosters had crowed new day arrived
Her will hed tell forthright
Whole clan though first surprised praised them
She was strong-willed wholesome
Unlike those with wanton intents
Friendship love would well blend
They shared one bed and then chess rhymes
Sipped wine played chess at times
Watched flowers bloom nighttimes Moon rise
Wishes love were realized
Friendship marriage united fused
She had temple produced
Had one guide Giác Duyên to the shrine
Temples gate was locked tight
Moss filled all chinks grass dyed ceiling
Shed gone herb-gathering
Like clouds herons straying toward where
For debts from past affairs
At shrine incense was there days nights
Wealth bliss spanned thousand lives
Kims positions rose high higher
Kims home filled with vigorous boys
Peerless wealth bliss enjoyed
With Spring-filled yard name coiled in praise
All things Heaven dictates
Heaven ordains mans fate wholly
Doomed to stray stray youll be
If born lofty loftinesss gained
Heaven fairly ordains
Why lean on ones talent
Talent and Misfortune form rhymes
Since karmas passed through time
Blame not Heaven far nigh for naught
From ones heart goodnesss wrought
Heart equals thrice begot Talent
Long are home-brewed statements
Theyve brought some enjoyment this night
