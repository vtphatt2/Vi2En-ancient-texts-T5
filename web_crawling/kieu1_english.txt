A hundred years in this life span on earth
Talent and destiny are apt to feud
You must go through a play of ebb and flow
Watch such things as make you sick at heart
Is it so strange that losses balance gains?
Blue Heaven's wont to strike a rose from spite
By lamplight turn these scented leaves and read
A tale of love recorded in old books
Under the Chia ching reign when Ming held sway
All lived at peace both capitals stood strong
There was a burgher in the clan of Virong
a man of modest wealth and middle rank
He had a last born son, Vương Quan his hope
to carry on a line of learned folk
Two daughters, beauties both, had come before:
Thúy Kiều was oldest, younger was Thúy Vin
Bodies like slim plum branches, snow pure souls
each her own self, each perfect in her way
In quiet grace Van was beyond compare:
her face a moon, her eyebrows two full curves;
her smile a flower, her voice the song of jade;
her hair the sheen of clouds, her skin white snow
Yet Kiều possessed a keener, deeper charm
surpassing Vain in talents and in looks
Her eyes were autumn streams, her brows spring hill
Flowers grudged her glamour, willows her fresh hue
A glance or two from her, and kingdoms rocked!
Supreme in looks, she had few peers in gifts
By Heaven blessed with wit, she knew all skills:
she could write verse and paint, could sing and chant
Of music she had mastered all five tones
and played the lute far better than Ai Chang
She had composed a song called Cruel Fare
to mourn all women in soul rending strains
A paragon of grace for womanhood
she neared that time when maidens pinned their hair
She calmly lived behind drawn shades and drapes
as wooers swarmed, unheeded, by the wall
Swift swallows and spring days were shuttling by
of ninety radiant ones three score had fled
Young grass spread all its green to heaven's Ti
some blossoms marked pear branches with white dots
Now came the Feast of Light in the third month
with graveyard rites and junkets on the green
As merry pilgrims flocked from near and far
the sisters and their brother went for a stroll
Fine men and beauteous women on parade:
a crush of clothes, a rush of wheels and steeds
Folks clambered burial knolls to strew and burn
sham gold or paper coins, and ashes swirled
Now, as the sun was dipping toward the west
the youngsters started homeward, hand in hand
With leisured steps they walked along a brook
admiring here and there a pretty view
The rivulet, babbling, curled and wound its course
under a bridge that spanned it farther down
Beside the road a mound of earth loomed up
where withered weeds, half yellow and half green
Kiều asked: Now that the Feast of Light is on
why is no incense burning for this grave?
'Vương Quan told her this tale from first to last:
She was a famous singer once, Đạm Tiên
Renowned for looks and talents in her day
she lacked not lovers jostling at her door
But fate makes roses fragile in mid spring
off broke the flower that breathed forth heaven's scents
From overseas a stranger came to woo
and win a girl whose name spread far and wide
But when the lover's boat sailed into port
he found the pin had snapped, the vase had crashed
A death still silence filled the void, her room;
all tracks of horse or wheels had blurred to moss
He wept, full of a grief no words could tell:
Harsh is the fate that has kept us apart!
Since in this life we are not meant to meet
Jet me pledge you my troth for our next life
He purchased both a coffin and a hearse
and rested her in dust beneath this mound
among the grass and flowers For many moons
who's come to tend a grave that no one claims
A wall of pity lay within Kiéu s heart:
as soon as she had heard her tears burst forth
How sorrowful is women s lot! she cried
We all partake of woe, our common fate
Creator, why are you so mean and cruel
blighting green days and fading rose fresh cheeks?
Alive, she played the wife to all the world
alas, to end down there without a man!
Where are they now who shared in her embrace?
Where are they now who lusted for her charms?®
Since no one else gives her a glance, a thought
Til light some incense candles while I'm here
Til mark our chance encounter on the road
perhaps, down by the Yellow Springs, she'll know
She prayed in mumbled tones, then she knelt down
to make a few low bows before the tomb
Dusk gathered on a patch of wilted weeds
reed tassels swayed as gently blew the breeze
She pulled a pin out of her hair and graved
four lines of stop short verse on a tree's bark
Deeper and deeper sank her soul in trance
all hushed, she tarried there and would not leave
The cloud on her fair face grew darker yet:
as sorrow ebbed or flowed, tears dropped or streamed
Vain said: My sister, you should be laughed at
lavishing tears on one long dead and gone!
Since ages ont of mind, retorted Kiều
harsh fate has cursed all women, sparing none
As I see her lie there, it hurts to think
what will become of me in later days
A fine speech you just made! protested Quan
It jars the ears to hear you speak of her
and mean yourself Dank air hangs heavy here
day's failing, and there s still a long way home
Kiều said: When one who shines in talent dies
the body passes on, the soul remains
In her, perhaps, I've found a kindred heart
let's wait and soon enough she may appear
Before they could respond to what Kiều said
a whirlwind rose from nowhere, raged and raved
It blustered, strewing buds and shaking trees
and scattering whiffs of perfume in the air
They strode along the path the whirlwind took
and plainly saw fresh footprints on the moss
They stared at one another, terror struck
You've heard the prayer of my pure faith! Kiều cried
As kindred hearts, we've joined each other here
transcending life and death, soul sisters meet
Dam Tiên had cared to manifest herself
to what she'd written Kiều now added thanks
A poet's feelings, rife with anguish, flowed:
she carved an old style poem on the tree
To leave or stay they all were wavering still
when nearby rang the sound of harness bells
They saw a youthful scholar come theit way
astride a colt he rode with slackened rein
He carried poems packing half his bag
and tagging at his heels were some page boys
His frisky horse's coat was dyed with snow
His gown blent tints of grass and pale blue sky
He spied them from afar, at once alit
and walked toward them to pay them his respects
His figured slippers trod the green the field
now sparkled like some jade and ruby grove
Young Vuong stepped forth and greeted him he knew
while two shy maidens hid behind the flowers
He came from somewhere not so far away
Kim Trọng, a scion of the noblest stock
Born into wealth and talent, he'd received
this wit from heaven, a scholar's trade from men
Manner and mien set him above the crowd:
he studied books indoors, lived high abroad
Since birth he'd always called this region home
he and young Vương were classmates at their school
His neighbors fame had spread and reached his ear:
two beauties locked in their Bronze Sparrow Tower!
But, as if hills and streams had barred the way
he had long sighed and dreamt of them, in vain
How lucky, in this season of new leaves
to roam about and find his yearned for flowers!
He caught a fleeting glimpse of both afar:
spring orchid, autumn mum a gorgeous pair!
Beautiful girl and talented young man
what stirred their hearts their eyes still dared not say
They hovered, rapture bound, tween wake and dream:
they could not stay, nor would they soon depart
The dusk of sunset prompted thoughts of gloom
he left, and longingly she watched him go
Below a stream flowed clear, and by the bridge
a twilit willow rustled threads of silk
When Kiều got back behind her flowered drapes
the sun had set, the curfew gong had rung
Outside the window, squinting, peeped the moon
gold spilled on waves, trees shadowed all the yard
East drooped a red camellia, toward the next house:
as dewdrops fell, the spring branch bent and bowed
Alone, in silence, she beheld the moon
her heart a raveled coil of hopes and fears:
Lower than that no person could be brought!
It's just a bauble then, the glittering life
And who is he? Why did we chance to meet?
Does fate intend some tie between us two?
Her bosom heaved in turmoil she poured forth
a wondrous lyric fraught with all she felt
The moonlight through the blinds was falling slant
Leaning against the window, she drowsed of
Now out of nowhere there appeared a girl
of worldly glamour joined to virgin grace:
face washed with dewdrops, body clad in snow
and hovering feet, two golden lotus blooms
With joy Kigu hailed the stranger, asking her:
Did you stray here from that Peach Blossom Spring?
We two are sister souls, the other said
Have you forgotten? We just met today!
My cold abode lies west of here, out there
above a running brook, below a bridge
By pity moved, you stooped to notice me
and strew on me poetic pearls and gems
I showed them to our League Chief and was told '
your name is marked in the Book of the Damned
We both reap what we sowed in our past lives:
of the same League, we ride the selfsame boat
Well, ten new subjects our League Chief just set:
again please work your magie with a brush
Kigu did as asked and wrote with nymphic grace
her hand dashed off ten lyrics at one stroke
Dam Tiên read them and marveled to herself:
Rich wrought embroidery from a heart of gold!
Included in the Book of Sorrow Songs
they'll yield the palm to none but win first prize
The caller crossed the doorsill, turned to leave
but Kigu would hold her back and talk some more
A sudden gust of wind disturbed the blinds
and Kiều awakened, knowing she had dreamed
She looked, but nowhere could she see the girl
though hints of perfume lingered here and there
Alone with her dilemma in deep night
she viewed the road ahead and dread seized her
A rose afloat, a water fern adrift:
such was the lot her future held in store
Her inmost feelings surged, wave after wave:
again and yet again she broke and cried
Kiều s sobs sent echoes through the phoenix drapes
Aroused, her mother asked: What troubles you
that you stil stir and fret at dead of night
your cheeks like some pear blossoms drenched with rain?
Kigu said: You once bore me, you've brought me up
a double debt I've not repaid one whit
Today, while strolling, found Pam Tién s grave
then in a dream she just revealed herself
She told me how by fate I'm doomed to grief
delivered themes on which Ï wrote some songs
As I interpret what the dream portends
my life in days ahead won't come to much!
Her mother said: Are dreams and vapors grounds
whereon to build a tale of woe? Just think!
Kigu tried to heed such words of sound advice
but soon her tears welled up and flowed again
Outside the window chirped an oriole
over the wall a catkin flew next door
The tilting moonlight lay aslant the porch
she stayed alone, alone with her own grief
How strange, the race of lovers! Try as you will
you can t unsnarl their hearts entangled threads
Since Kim was back inside his book lined walls
he could not drive her from his haunted mind
He drained the cup of gloom: it filled anew
one day without her seemed three autumns long
Silk curtains veiled her windows like dense clouds
and toward the rose within he'd dream his way
The moon kept waning, oil kept burning low:
his face yearned for her face, his heart her heart
The study room turned icy, metal cold
brushes lay dry, lute strings hung loose on frets
Hsiang bamboo blinds stirred rustling in the wind
incense roused longing, tea lacked love's sweet taste
If fate did not mean them to join as mates
why had the temptress come and teased his eyes?
Forlorn, he missed the scene, he missed the girl:
he rushed back where by chance the two had met
A tract of land with grasses lush and green
with waters crystal clear: he saw naught else
The breeze at twilight stirred a moad of grief
the reeds waved back and forth as if to taunt
A lover's mind is full of her he loves:
he walked straight on and made toward her Blue Bridge
Fast gate, high wall: no stream for his red leaf
no passage for his bluebird bearing word
A willow dropped its curtain of silk threads
perched on a branch, an oriole chirped jeers
All doors were shut, all bolts were locked in place
A threshold strewn with flowers where was she?
He lingered, standing there as time passed by
then to the rear he strolled he saw a house
Its owner, traveling heathen climes for trade
was still away left vacant were the rooms
Young Kim, as student, came to rent the house
he brought his lute, his books, and settled in
He lacked for nothing trees and racks, a porch
inscribed in vivid gold: Kingfisher View '
The porch's name made him exult inside
Itmust be Heaven s will that we should meet!
He left his window open just a crack
and daily glanced his eyes toward that east wall
Nearby both spring and grotto stayed tight shut:
he failed to see the nymph flit in and out
Since he left home to dwell at this strange lodge
twice on its rounds the moon had come and gone
Now, ona balmy day, across the wall
he glimpsed a lissome form beneath peach trees
He dropped the lute, smoothed down his gown, rushed out:
her scent was wafting still of her no trace
As he paced round the wall, his eye espied
a golden hairpin caught on a peach branch
He reached for it and took it home He thought:
It left a woman's chamber and came here
This jewel must be hers Why, fate binds us
ifnot, could it have fallen in my hands?
Now sleepless, he admired and stroked the pin
still faintly redolent of sandalwood
At dawn when mists had cleared, he found the girl
peering along the wall with puzzled eyes
The student had been lurking there in wait
across the wall he spoke to test her heart:
From nowhere have found this hairpin here:
Iwould send back the pearl, but where's Ho
Now from the other side Kiều s voice was heard:
1 thank him who won t keep a jewel found
A pin's worth little, but it means so much
that in your scale what's right weighs more than gold
He said: We come and go in these same parts
we're neighbors, not two strangers, not at all!
Towe this moment to some scent you dropped
but countless torments I've endured till now
So long I've waited for just this one day!
Stay on and let me ask your private thoughts
He hurried off and fetched some things from home:
gold bracelets in a pair, a scarf of silk
By ladder he could climb across the wall:
she was the one he'd met that day, no doubt!
Ashamed, the girl maintained a shy reserve:
while he gazed at her face, she hung her head
He said: We chanced to meet and ever since
Ihave in secret yearned and pined for you
My slender frame has wasted who'd have thought
that I could linger on to see this day?
For months I dreamt my goddess in the clouds;
lovelorn, I hugged my post, prepared to drown
But you are here I beg to ask one thing
will on a leaf of grass the mirror shine?
She faltered after some demur she said:
Our ways are snow pure, plain as turnip greens
When comes the time for love, the marriage bond
my parents wish will tie it or will not
You deign to care for me, but I'm too young
to know what's right and dare not give my word
He said: It blows one day and rains the next
how often does chance favor us in spring?
If you ignore and scorn my desperate love
you'll hurt me yet what will it profit you?
Let's pledge our troth with something once that s done
Till plan our wedding through a go between
Should Heaven disappoint my fondest hopes
Til throw away a life in vernal bloom
Iftoa lover's plea you shut your heart
TÌI have pursued you all in vain, for naught!
All hushed, she drank in words whose music lulled
love stirred the autumn calm of her Fair eyes
She said: Although our friendship's still quite new
how can my heart resist your heart's behest?
To your kind bosom you have taken me
Tiletch your word, our troth, in stone and bronze
Her words untied a knot within iis breast
to her he passed gold bracelets and red scarf
Henceforth °m bound to you for life he said
Call these small gifts a token of my love
In hand she had a sunflower figured fan:
she traded it that instant for her pin
They had just sworn an oath to seal their pact
when from the backyard voices came, abuzz
Both fled in flurries leaves and flowers fell
and he regained his study, she her room
The stone and gold had touched and from that time
their love grew deeper, more distraught their minds
The Hsiang, the stream of longing tears, ran low:
he waited at the spring, she at the mouth
The wall rose like a snow capped mountain range
and words of love could not go back and forth
As windswept days and moonlit nights wheeled round
red dimmed, green deepened spring was past and gone
A birthday feast fell due in Mother s clan:
with their two younger children, both old folks
in gay attire left home to journey forth
presenting their best wishes and a giết
A hushed, deserted house she stayed alone:
aa chance to see him on this day, she thought
She set out fare in season, treats galore
then toward the wall she bent her nimble steps
She sent a soft voiced call across the flowers:
he was already there awaiting her
He said: Your heart cares not for what I feel
so long you've let love s fire burn to cold ash
Sorrow and yearning I have felt by turns
and half my head of hair frost s tinged with gray
She said: Wind's held me up, rain s kept me back
T've hurt your feelings much against my wish
Tm home alone today I've come out here
to make amends repaying love for love
She slid around the rock garden and reached
a fresh barred passage at the walls far end
She rolled up sleeves, unlocked the fairy cave
and cleared through clouds the path to Paradise!
Face gazed at face to glow with purest joy
Fond greetings they exchanged Then, side by side
they walked together toward his study room
while mingling words of love and vows of troth
Brush rack and tube for poems on his desk
above, there hung a sketch of pale green pines
Frost bitten and wind battered, they looked real:
the more she gazed, the more they sprang to life
It's something I dashed off just now, he said
Please write your comments, lending it some worth
Her nymphic hand moved like a lashing storm
and penned some quatrains right atop the pines
Your magic conjures gems and pearls! he cried
Could Pan and Hsieh have measured up to this?
If I did not earn merit in past lives
ould I be blessed with you, my treasure, now?
She said: I've dared to peek and read your face:
you shall wear jade or cross the Golden Gate
But | deem my own lot a mayfiy s wing:
will Heaven square things out and round things off ?
Back in my childish years, I still recall
a seer observed my features he foretold:
All charms and splendors from within burst forth
she'll live an artists life, a life of woe
Hook at you, then on myself look back:
how could good luck, ill huck conjoin and thrive?
He said: That we have met means fate binds us
Man's will has often vanquished Heaven's whim
But should the knot which ties us fall apart
Tl keep my troth and sacrifice my life
They bared and shared all secrets of their souls
spring feelings quivered hearts, spring wine turned heads
A happy day is shorter than a span:
the western hills had swallowed up the sun
With none at home, she could no longer stay
she left him, rushing back to her own room
News of her folks she learned when she reached home:
her feasting parents would not soon be back
She dropped silk curtains at the entrance door
then crossed the garden in dark night, alone
The moon through branches cast shapes bright or dark
through curtains glimmered flickers of a lamp
The student at his desk had nodded of
reclining half awake and half asleep
The girl's soft footsteps woke him from his drowse:
the moon was setting as she hovered near
He wondered was this Wu hsia the fairy hill
where he was dreaming now a spring night's dream?
Alonga lonesome, darkened path, she said
for love of you I found my way to you
Now we stand face to face but who can tell
we shan t wake up and learn it was a dream?
He bowed and welcomed her, then he replaced
the candle and refilled the incense urn
Both wrote a pledge of troth, and with a knife
they cut in two a lock of her long hair
The stark bright moon was gazing from the skies
as with one voice both mouths pronounced the oath
Their hearts recesses they explored and probed
etching their vow of union in their bones
Both sipped a nectar wine from cups of jade
silks breathed their scents, the mirror glassed their selves
The breeze blows cool, the moon shines clear, he said
but in my heart still burns a thirst unquenched
The pestle s yet to pound on the Blue Bridge
fear my bold request might give offense
She said: By the red leaf, the crimson thread
we're bound for life our oath proves mutual faith
Of love make not a sport, a dalliance
and what would I begrudge you otherwise?
He said: You've won wide fame as lutanist
like Chung Tzu ch i I've longed to hear you play
I's no great art, my luting, answered she
but if you so command, Ï must submit
In the back porch there hung his moon shaped lute
he hastened to present it in both hands
at eyebrow s height My petty skill, she cried
ig causing you more bother than it s worth!
By turns she touched the strings, both high and low
to tune all four to five tones, then she played
Anair, The Battlefield of Han and Chu
made one hear bronze and iron clash and clang
The Ssu ma tune, 4 Phoenix Seeks His Mate
sounded so sad, the moan of grief itself
Here was Chi K ang's famed masterpiece, Kuang ling
\was it a stream that flowed, a cloud that roamed?
Crossing the Border gate here was Chao chiin
half lonesome for her lord, half sick for home
Clear notes like cries of egrets flying past;
dark tones like torrents tumbling in mid course
Andantes languid as a wafting breeze;
allegros rushing like a pouring rain
The lamp now flared, now dimmed and there he sat
hovering between sheer rapture and deep gloom
He'd hug his knees or he'd hang down his head
he'd feel his entrails wrenching, knit his brows
Indeed, a master s touch, he said at last
but it betrays such bitterness within!
Why do you choose to play those plaintive strains
which grieve your heart and sorrow other souls?
T'm settled in my nature, she replied
Who knows why Heaven makes one sad or gay?
Bat | shall mark your golden words, their truth
and by degrees my ternper may yet mend
A fragrant rose, she sparkled in full bloom
bemused his eyes, and kindled his desire
When waves of lust had seemed to sweep him off
his wooing turned to wanton liberties
She said: Treat not our love as just a game
please stay away from me and let me speak
What is a mere peach blossom that one should
fence off the garden, thwart the blucbird s quest?
Bat you've named me your bride to serve her man
she must place chastity above all else
They play in mulberry groves along the P'u
but who would care for wenches of that ilk?
Are we to snatch the moment, pluck the fruit
and in one sole day wreck a lifelong trust?
Let's ponder those love stories old and new
what well matched pair could equal Tỷ ui and Chang?
Yet passion's storms did topple stone and bronze:
she cloyed her lover humoring all his whims
As wing to wing and limb tơ limb they lay
contempt already lurked beside their hearts
Under the western roof the two burned out
the incense of their vow, and love turned shame
If I don't cast the shuttle in defense
vwe'll ater blush for it who'll bear the guilt?
Why force your wish on your shy flower so soon ?
While I'm alive, you'll sometime get your due
The voice of sober reason gained his ear
and tenfold his regard for her increased
As silver paled along the eaves, they heard
an urgent call from outside his front gate
She ran back toward her chamber while young Kim
rushed out and crossed the yard where peaches bloomed
The brushwood gate unbolted, there came in
a houseboy with a missive fresh from home
Itsaid Kim s uncle while abroad had died
whose poor remains were now t0 be brought back
To far Liao yang, beyond the hills and streams
he'd go and lead the cortege, Father bade
What he'd just learned astounded Kim at once
he hurried to her house and broke the news
In full detail he told her how a death
striking his clan, would send him far away
We've scarcely seen each other now we part
We've had no chance to tie the mariage tie
But it's still there, the moon that we swore by
not face to face, we shall stay heart to heart
Acday will last three winters far from you:
my tangled knot of grief won't soon unknit
Care for yourself, my gold, my jade, that I
at the world s ends, may know some peace of mind
She heard him speak, her feelings in a snari
With broken words, she uttered what she thought:
Why does he hate us so who spins silk threads?
Before we've joined in joy we part in grief
Together we did swear a sacred oath:
my hair shall gray and wither, not my love
What matter if | must wait months and years?
Til think of my wayfaring man and grieve
We've pledged to wed our hearts T'll never leave
and play my lute aboard another's boat
As long as hills and streams endure, come back
remembering her who is with you today
They lingered hand in hand and could not part
bút now the sun stood plumb above the roof
Step by slow step he tore himself away
at each farewell their tears would fall in streams
Horse saddled and bags tied in haste, he left
they split their grief in half and parted ways
Strange landscapes met his mournful eyes on trees
cuckoos galore, at heaven's edge some geese
Grieve for him who must bear through wind and rain
aheart more loaded down with love each day
There she remained, her back against the porch
her feelings snarled like raveled skeins of silk
Through window bars she gazed at mists beyond
a washed out rose, a willow gaunt and pale
Distraught, she tarried walking back and forth
when from the birthday feast her folks returned
Before they could trade news of health and such
in burst a mob of bailiffs on all sides
With cudgels under arm and swords in hand
those fiends and monsters rushed around, berserk
They cangued them both, the old man, his young son
one cruel rope trussed two dear beings up
Then, like bluebottles buzzing through the house
they smashed workbaskets, shattered looms to bits
They grabbed all jewels, fineries, personal things
scooping the household clean to fill greed s bag
From nowhere woe had struck who'd caused it all?
Who'd somehow set the snare and sprung the trap?
Upon inquiry it was later learned
some knave who sold raw silk had brought a charge
Fear gripped the household cries of innocence
shook up the earth injustice dimmed the clouds
All day they groveled, begged, and prayed deaf ears
would hear no plea, harsh hands would spare no blow
A rope hung each from girders, by his heels
rocks would have broken, let alone mere men
Their faces spoke sheer pain and fright this wrong
could they appeal to Heaven far away?
Lawmen behaved that day as is their wont
wreaking dire havoc just for money's sake
By what means could she save her flesh and blood?
When evil strikes, you bow to circumstance
As you must weigh and choose between your love
and filial duty, which will turn the scale?
She put aside all vows of love and troth
a child first pays the debts of birth and care
Resolved on what to do, she said: Hands off
THỊ sell myself and Father I'l redeem
There was an elderly scrivener surnamed Chung
a bureaucrat who somehow had a heart
He witnessed how a daughter proved her love
and felt some secret pity for her plight
Planning to pave this way and clear that path
he reckoned they would need three hundred liang
He'd have her kinsmen freed for now, bade her
provide the sum within two days or three
Pity the child, so young and so naive
misfortune, like a storm, swooped down on her
To part from Kim meant sorrow, death in life
would she still care for life, much less for Love?
A raindrop does not brood on its poor fate;
a leaf of grass repays three months of spring
Matchmakers were advised of her intent
brisk rumor spread the tidings near and far
There lived a woman in that neighborhood
who brought a suitor, one from out of town
When asked, he gave his name as Scholar Ma
and claimed his home to be Lin ch ing, near here
Past forty, far beyond the bloom of youth
he wore a smooth shaved face and smart attire
Master and men behind came bustling in
the marriage broker ushered him upstairs
He grabbed the best of seats and sat in state
while went the broker bidding Kiều come out
Crushed by her kinsfolk's woe and her own grief
she crossed the sill, tears flowing at each step
She felt the chill of winds and dews, ashamed
to look at flowers or see her mirrored face
The broker smoothed her hair and stroked her hand
coaxing a wilted mum, a gaunt plum branch
He pondered looks, gauged skills he made her play
the moon shaped lute, write verses on a fan
Of her lush charms he relished each and all:
well pleased, he set to bargaining a deal
He said: For jade I've come to this Blue Bridge
tell me how much the bridal gift will cost
The broker said: She's worth her weight in gold!
But im distress they'll look to your big heart
They haggled hard and long, then struck a deal:
the price for her, four hundred and some liang
All was smooth paddling once they gave their word
as pledges they swapped horoscopic cards
and set the day when, full paid for, she'd wed
When cash is ready, what cannot be fixed?
Old Chung was asked to help at his request
old Vương could on probation go back home
Pity the father facing his young child
Looking at her, he bled and died within:
You raise a daughter wishing she might find
a fitting match, might wed a worthy mate
O Heaven, why inflict such woes on us?
Who slandered us to tear our home apart?
1 would not mind the ax for these old bones
but how can I endure my child's ordeal?
Death now of later happens only once
I'd rather pass away than suffer so
After he'd said those words he shed more tears
and made to knock his head against a wall
They rushed to stop him, then she softly spoke
and with some words of comfort calmed him down:
What is she worth, a stripting of a girl
who's not repaid one whit a daughter's debts?
Ying once shamed me, petitioning the throne
could T fall short of Li who sold herself2
Asit grows old, the cedar is a tree
that singly shoulders up so many boughs
If moved by love you won't let go of me
fear a storm will blow and blast our home
You'd better sacrifice just me one flower
will turn to shreds, but green will stay the leaves
Whatever lot befalls me T accept
think me a blossom nipped when budding green
Let no wild notions run around your head
or you shall wreck our home and hurt yourself
Words of good sense sank smoothly in his ear
they stared at one another, pouring tears
Outside, that Scholar Ma appeared again
they signed the contract, silver then changed hands
A wanton god, the Old Man of the Moon
at random tying couples with his threads!
When money s held in hand it's no great trick
swaying men s hearts and turning black to white
Old Chung did all he could and gave all help:
gifts once presented, charges were dismissed
Her family's woes were settled for a time
but now the bridal hour drew on apace
Alone, she huddled by the midnight lamp
with tear soaked gown and sorrow withered hair:
No matter what fate deals me, I will grieve
for him who's steadfast kept the vow he swore
How much he toiled and strove to win my love!
But grown attached to me, he s marred his life
The cup we both drank from has barely dried
when I now break my oath and play him false
In far away Liao yang how can he guess
our union's torn asunder by my hand?
So many vows of love we traded once!
Oh, what will they amount to in this life?
But haunted by troth incense we once burned
Ti be reborn a beast and make amends
Till I've paid off my debt of love to him
my heart will stay a crystal down below
Her secret thoughts kept spinning round and round
as lamp oil burned away, tears drenched her scarf
Thúy Vân, who just awoke from some sweet dream
stopped by the lamp and with concern inquired:
In Heaven's complex scheme of flux and change
you're left to bear the family s woes alone
Is that why you've stayed up the livelong night?
Or with some secret are you still beset?
Kiều said: My heart s near bursting, for it s caught
in love's own webs and tangles yet unsnarled
feel ashamed to part my lips and tell
but if I hid it I would wrong his love
Should you agree I'll ask you Please sit down
and let me bow to you before I speak
Midway my bonds of love with him have snapped
let me trust you to mend and splice what's left
Since | met Kim 1 gave my fan in pledge
we drank of the same cup and swore our troth
Then out of nowhere broke a storm on us
how could both love and duty be fulfilled?
You have long days of spring ahead please heed
the call of blood, redeem my pledge for me
Though flesh and bones will then have turned to dust
Tl breathe your happiness and smile down there
Bracelets and pledge on paper decked with clouds:
preserve this troth, these things are jointly ours
When bound as man and wife, you two will mourn
a star crossed girl and nurse her in your hearts
I shall have vanished leaving few remains:
a lute, troth incense burned in days gone by
Sometime, if ever you will tune this lute
or light that incense vessel, look outdoors:
among the grass and leaves you'll see a breeze
waft back and forth you'll know that I've come home
My soul, still haunted by the oath, will try
to keep my pledge though I'l have turned to naught
The world of night will hide my face, my voice
yet, please shed tears for someone wronged by fate
Ah, now the pin has snapped, the vase has crashed:
past all expression, how I cherish him!
Through you I'll send my humblest bows to hit:
the tie of love between us is cụt short
Why have I drawn a lot as gray as dirt?
The flower's doomed to drift along the stream
O Kim, my dearest Kim! This is the end:
as of today I'll have betrayed your trust
That said, her blood went wild, her spirit swooned:
all breath fell hushed, both hands grew cold as ice
The parents rose at once from their deep steep
the household was astir inside and out
They bustled fetching some tisane, some drug:
she wakened from her faint, still wet with tears
They asked her why so strangely she behaved
Kiều sobbed and sobbed but could not speak one word
Van told her secret whispering in the ear:
These are the bracelets, here's the written pledge
Your father, I caused you to break your troth!
But may your sister honor it in your stead
Whose fault is it that lovers now must part
that now our child must lead a wanderer s life?
As to your wish, though stone may crumble down
my word will stand I shall not fail your trust
Before him she bowed low and softly said:
Father, help me fulfill my pledge to him
then I shan1 mind a slave's own lot or care
if T should leave my bones in alien soil
How to express her grief while on the tower
watchman tolled and tolled the hours of night?
A carriage, flower decked, arrived outside
with flutes and lutes to bid dear kin part ways
She grieved to go, they grieved to stay behind:
tears soaked stone steps as parting tugged their hearts
Across a twilit sky dragged sullen clouds
grasses and branches drooped, all drenched with dew
He led her to an inn and left her there
within four walls, a maiden in her spring
The girl felt torn between dire dread and shame
she'd sadly brood, her heart would ache and ache
A rose divine lay fallen in vile hands
once kept from sun or rain for someone's sake:
Ifonly Thad known I'd sink so low
| should have let my true love pluck my bud
Because I fenced it well from the east wind
I failed him then and make him suffer now
When we're to meet again, what will be left
of my poor body here to give much hope?
If | indeed was born to float and drift
how can a woman live with such a fate?
Upon the table lay a knife at hand
she grabbed it, hid it wrapped inside her scart:
Yes, if and when the flood should reach my feet
this knife may later help decide my life
The autumn night wore on, hour after hour
alone, she mused, half wakeful, half asleep
She did not know that Scholar Mã, the rogue
had always patronized the haunts of lust
The rake had hit a run of blackest luck
in whoredom our whoremaster sought his bread
Now, in a brothel, languished one Dame Tú
whose wealth of charms was taxed by creeping age
Mere hazard, undesigned, can bring things off:
sawdust and bitter melon met and merged
They pooled resources, opening a shop
to sell their painted dolls all through the year
Country and town they scoured for concubines
whom they would teach the trade of play and love
With Heaven lies your fortune, good or ill
and woe will pick you if youre marked for woe
Pity a small, frail bit of womankind
a flower sold to board a peddler s boat
She now was caught in all his bag of tricks
a paltry bridal gift, some slapdash rites
He crowed within: The flag has come to hand!
I view rare jade it stirs my heart of gold!
The kingdom's queen of beauty! Heaven's scent!
One smile of hers is worth pure gold it's true
When she gets there, to pluck the maiden bud
princes and gentlefolk will push and shove
She'll bring at least three hundred liang, about
what I have paid net profit after that
A morsel dangles at my mouth what God
serves up I crave, yet money hate to lose
À heavenly peach within a mortal's grasp:
Til bend the branch, pick it, and quench my thirst
How many flower fanciers on earth
can really tell one flower from the next?
Juice from pomegranate skin and cockscomb blood
will heal it up and lend the virgin look
In dim half light some yokel will be fooled:
she'll fetch that much, and not one penny less
If my old broad finds out and makes a scene
Tltake it like a man, down on my knees!
Besides, it's still a long, long way from home:
if don t touch her, later she'll suspect
Oh, shame! A pure camellia had to let
the bee explore and probe all ins and outs
Astorm of lust broke forth it would not spare
the flawless jade, respect the pristine scent
All this spring night was one bad dream she woke
to lie alone beneath the nuptial torch
Her tears of silent grief poured down like rain
she hated him, she loathed herself as much:
What breed is he, a creature foul and vile?
My body's now a blot on womanhood
What hope is left to cherish after this?
A life that s come to this is life no more
By turns she cursed her fate, she moaned her lot
She grabbed the knife and thought to kill herself
She mulled it over: IE I were alone
it wouldn't matter T've two loved ones, though
If trouble should develop afterwards
an inquest might ensue and work their doom
Perhaps my plight will ease with passing time
Sooner or later, I'm to die just once
While she kept tossing reasons back and forth, 4
a rooster shrilly crowed outside the wall
The watchtower horn soon blared through morning mists
so Mà gave orders, making haste to leave
Oh, how it rends the heart, the parting hour
when horse begins to trot and wheels to jolt! 5
Ten miles beyond the city, at a post
the father gave a feast to bid farewell
While host and guests were making cheer outside
mother and Kiều were huddling now indoors
As they gazed at each other through hot tears, §
Kiều whispered all her doubts in mother s ear:
m just a girl, so helpless, to my shame
| when could | ever pay a daughter's debts?
Lost here where water s mud and dust s soil free
Tilleave with you my heart from now, for life 8
To judge by what I've noticed these past days
Tfear a scoundrel s hands are holding me
When we got there, he left me all alone
He tarried coming in, but out he dashed
He halts and stammers often when he talks 8
His men make light of him, treat him with scorn
He lacks the ease and grace of gentlefolk
seeming just like some merchant on close watch
What else to say? Your daughter's doomed to live
on foreign land and sleep in alien soil
Atall those words, Dame Vương let out a shriek
that would pierce heaven, crying for redress
Before they had drunk dry the parting cup
Mã rushed outside and urged the coach to leave
Mourning his daughter in his heavy heart
old Vương stood by the saddle begging M:
Because fate struck her family this frail girl
is now reduced to serving you as slave
Henceforth, beyond the sea, at heaven's edge
she'll live lone days with strangers, rain or shine
On you, her lofty oak, she will depend
a vine you'll shelter from cold frosts and snows
'Whereat the bridegroom said: ''Our feet are bound
by that mysterious thread of crimson silk
The sun's my witness if I should break faith
may all the demons strike me with their swords!
By stormwinds hurtled under rolling clouds
the coach roared off in swirls of ocher dust
Wiping their tears, they followed with their eyes:
on that horizon, day and night, they'd gaze
She traveled far, far into the unknown
Bridges stark white with frost, woods dark with clouds
Reeds huddling close while blew the cold north wind
an autumn sky for her and her alone
A road that stretched far off in hushed, still night
she saw the moon, felt shame at her love vows
Fall woods green tiers all interlaid with red:
bird cries reminded her of her old folks
She crossed unheard of streams, climbed nameless hills
the moon waxed full again: Lin tzu was reached
The carriage stopped before an entrance gate
a woman, parting curtains, stalked right out
One noticed at first glance her pallid skin
what did she feed upon to gain such bulk?
With wanton cheer she met them by the coach
Kiều, at her bidding, meekly stepped indoors
On one side, there sat girls with penciled brows
and on the other four or five gay blades
Between, an altar all rigged out: above
the image of that god with hoary brows
In bawdyhouses old tradition bids
them worship him as patron of their trade
offer him flowers, burn incense day and night
When some jinxed gal drew too few customers
in front of him she'd doff her shirt and skirt
then light some incense candies mumbling prayer
She'd take all faded flowers ta line her mat
and bees would swarm a buzzing all around!
Bewildered, unaware of what it was
Kiều just knelt down as told the bawd then prayed:
May fortune bless this house and business thrive
n nights of mirth, on days of revelry!
lay all men fall in love with her and come
locking like orioles and swallow birdst
t billets dotux and messages pour in!
Let clients throng both doorways, front and back!
strange sounds that made no sense to Kiéu's stunned ears
jand that whole scene struck her as all amiss
Once she'd paid homage to her houschold god
Dame Tú installed herself upon a couch
She ordered: Kmeel and bow before your aunt
then go and kowtow to your uncle there
By fortune banished from my home, said Kiều
Thugged my humble lot as concubine
A swallow s somehow turned an oriole:
what's my real status I'm too young to know
With bridal presents, wedding rites, and all
wwe did share bed and board, as man and wife
But now it seems the roles and ranks have changed:
Í may | beg you to make it clear for me?
The woman heard the tale and learned the truth
her devils, fiends, and demons all broke loose:
What happened is as plain as day to see!
She caught my man alive for her own use!
1 sent him for some lass to bring back here
and put to work as hostess, earn our bread
But that false hearted knave, that beastly rogue
had his damn itch he played and messed with her
Now that the cloth has lost all starch and glaze
there goes to hell the money I put up!
You litte strumpet, they sold you to me
and in my house you go by my house rules
When that old lecher tried his dirty trick
why did you listen? Slap his face, instead!
Why did you just lie there and take it all?
The merest chit, do you already rut?
1 must teach you how I lay down the law
She grabbed a whip, about to pounce and lash
Heaven and earth bear witness! Kiều cried out
My life I threw away when I left home
What now remains of it to have and hold?
At once she pulled the knife out of her sleeve
O horror, she found heart to kill herself!
The bawd stood watching, helpless, as Kiều stabbed
Alas, were all such perfect gifts and charms
to leave this earth, dissevered by a knife?
The girl's misfortune soon got noised abroad
a crowd came pouring in and packed the house
While she was lying there in slumber s lap
the bawd just stared and shook, her wits scared off
Then Kiều was carried out to the west porch
someone nursed her, a doctor was called in
Her ties to earth were not yet sundered, though
asleep, Kiều sensed a girl was standing by
And whispered she: Your karma s still undone:
how could you shirk your debt of grief to life?
You're still to bear the fortune of a rose:
you wish to quit, but Heaven won't allow
Live and fulfill your destiny, frail reed:
ơn the Ch'ien t ang we two shall meet again
With balms and salves applied all through the day
Kiều slowly wakened from her deathlike swoon
Dame Trủ was waiting by the patient's bed
to coax her into line with chosen words:
How many lives can anybody claim?
You are a rosebud spring has scarcely sprung
Something has gone awry how could I force
your sterling virtue into games of love?
But since you've strayed and ended here, lock up
your chamber waiting for your nuptial day
While you still have your body you have all
you'll make a perfect match with some young heir
Why visit havoc on a blameless head?
Why lose your life and hurt me? What's the good?
The earnest plea she murmured in Kiều s ear
sounded like logic, sorting right from wrong
Besides, there was the message of her dream:
in human fortune Heaven takes a hand
If she died now and left her debt unpaid
she'd pay with interest in some future life
She listened, thinking hard from first to last
then said: Who would have all this come to pass?
If you make good your word, I'll thank my luck
But will tomorrow's deed match what's pledged now?
1 dread to deal with bees and butterflies
Td sooner die unsoiled than live in mud
The madam said: My daughter, ease your mind
How could I have the heart to humbug you?
TẾ later I renege, there sits my judge
the sun that shines on us from overhead
An oath so solemn set Kigu s heart at rest
little by little all her fears were calmed
Locked in her spring at Crystal Tower, she lived
with friends some hills far off, the moon near by
On all four sides her ranging eyes could see
the gold of dunes, the ocher dust of trails
With shame she watched dawn clouds, the midnight lamp
the scene and what she felt both filled her soul
He'd shared the cup with her beneath the moon
now, day by day, he longed for news of her
Stranded and waifed upon a distant shore
when could she ever cleanse her heart of love?
She grieved for those awaiting at the door:
who fanned them now when hot, warmed them when cold?
After these months, the yard s catalpa tree
must be a size to stretch her arms around
She sadly watched the harbor in gray dusk
whose boat was that with fluttering sails, far off?
She sadly watched the river flow to sea
where would this flower end, adrift and lost?
She sadly watched the field of wilted grass
the bluish haze where merged the earth and clouds
She sadly watched the wind whip up the cove
and set all waves a roaring round her seat
Hemmed in by foreign streams and alien hills
the exile cried her grief in sad quatrains
Dully, she dropped the curtain, then she heard
a voice across the wall reply her poems
He was a stranger in the flush of youth
with polished image, elegant cap and robe
She thought him one brought up among fine books
when she inquired, she learned he was Sở K hanh
He'd glimpsed the charmer hid behind the shade
and seemed heart smitten he declared his love:
Alas, a beauty fit for kings and gods!
By what queer twist of fate did she stray here?
She ought to rule the moon, among the clouds
how could a rose be doomed to this vile life?
My bosom boils at Heaven, that old scamp
but can she guess your feelings, O my heart?
Tronly she could know, here is the man
| who'll free her from her cage it's mere child s play
The auturnn window shut tight once again
is sonorous words still echoed in her ears
> She thought of him, and then thought of herself:
his pity touched her she felt less a waif
Day followed day, so humdrum, rain or shine
when could she ever leave this dust gray life?
She'd take a chance, send word and beg the man
to pluck her from the sea of all her woes
Aletter told her tale: how she had paid
a daughter's debts and by ill luck strayed here
Asdawn broke through the morning mists and glowed
she had a messenger deliver it
The gold lit sky was blurring in the west
when from the man a prompt reply arrived
She opened his fine paper note and read:
two characters, li yeh, in clear cut strokes
She tried to penetrate their hidden sense:
The twenty first, hour of the dog, perhaps
Through dusk birds shuttled flying home to woods
over camellias peeped just half a moon
Branches stirred shadows on the eastern wall:
parting the shutters, lo, Sở Khanh crept in
Abashed, she rallied heart to weleome hìm
on bended knees, she whispered her appeal:
A water fern, a bubble that s my fate
T've strayed to fall among these birds of mirth
May I beg you to give me back my life?
For you I shall knot grass and fetch jade rings
He listened, nodding, grinning to himself
then said: I m not just anybody, mind!
Since you trust me and turn to me for help
Til drain it, fill it in, your sea of woes!
I'll rest on you for everything, she
Decide adopt whatever plan you will
He said: I have some horses fleet as winds
and in my service quite a brawny chap
Let's grasp our opportunity, slip away!
Can any scheme on earth surpass swift ight?
If something should by any chance go wrong
itwill not matter for I shall be there
Her worst suspicions quickened at this speech
but gone too far, she could not now draw back
She shut her eyes and headlong flung herself
to see how far the Maker would roll her
Together they stole down the stairs and left
each on a horse, the girl behind the man
The auturnn night was waning Wind lashed trees
spilt leaves; the woods had swallowed up the moon
Grass wanly gleamed with dew along the trail
as step by step she went, she yearned for home
In throaty chorus cocks were crowing dawn
when from the rear she heard a hue and cry
Her heart began to thump inside her breast
| Sở Khanh had quick turned rein and somewhere fled
She knew not what to do, left all alone
to jolt her way in terror through the woods
0 Heaven, wanton knave, how could your heart
let you thus crush and trample down a rose?
A gang closed in on her she had no claws
to burrow and escape, no wings to fly
Dame Tú arrived in hot haste on the scene
and swept her up to drag her home forthwith
The madam asked no questions wild with rage
she thrashed the flower, flailed the willow tree
All human beings are but flesh and blood
what rose, when torn and shattered, feels no pain?
Kiều spared no words she pleaded, she confessed
bowing her mangled back, her bloodied head
She said: This litle woman left her home
to trek through hills and streams and founder here
Now in your hands you hold my life or death
Brought to this pass, my person's reached an end
What care I for myself? My fate is set
But your investment would you really risk?
How can an ee! mind muddying its head?
Hereafter TÌI forget my maiden shame
The bawd seized on Kiéu s promise she required
a guarantor, a pledge in black and white
Among the housemates was a girl, Mã Kigu
who pitied her and dared to vouch for her
The bawd kept grilling her and flaying her
till she had spent her fury, then she quit
They carried Kiều indoors to nurse her wounds
Ma Kiều spoke out her mind and gave advice:
You did fall prey to him, an arrant scamp
who ever hasn't heard of that Sở Khanh?
It's asa brothel cad he s made his name
his hand has plucked and buried many flowers
Both planned and played that feint, the sword in fight
for bawd and pimp connived, as thick as thieves
Some thirty liang had passed from her to him
iff not, would he have put that comedy on?
Now that the deed is done, he'll turn about:
don t you provoke him or you'll lose your life
But he did swear those sacred oaths! Kiều said
How can he prove a man of such deceit?
Kigu was still brooding over this or that
when he came ushering in his brazen face
Sở Khanh harangued for all the world to hear:
They say a wench, newcomer in this house
has claimed I tempted her, led her astray
Let her face me, see who I really am
She answered hìm: Let's not discuss it, then
You say it didn t happen so it did not!
Sở Khanh cursed her, damned her in thundering tones
Si Came nt let with fats All ringed te eke
) Heaven, she exclaimed, you do know who
2ught this to pass, seducing me, poor girl!
led me on, then pushed me down the pit
swore to me, then broke his oath at once
y hand still holds his note, which says hsi vii
at face was his own face whose else was it?
Her forthright words were heard by one and all:
y scorned his perfidy, his heartless scheme
¢ lover's breach of faith was plain to see:
tmefaced, the rascal beat a quick retreat
Alone in her own room, she sobbed and wept
›oding upon herself, she mourned her lot:
pity! A thing frost pure and silver white
st rol] in dust and storm, like all the rest
L grief or joy, it s just one human Fate:
| mere rose to last forevermore?
cause I badly lived an earlier life
v in this world I must redeem past sins
'innocence is lost a broken vase:
body shall pay off my debts to life
The mirror of the moon was shining bright
me Tú sat down by Kiều and lectured her
he trade of love, my girl, takes care and pains
| we who ply it must know all its tricks
am the toy of winds and storms, Kigu said
I must give my body, so be it!
The bawd continued: Men are all alike:
y'l get their money's worth or won't come here
sre are more things to love than meet the eye
| ways to cope with men by day or dark
ow these by heart learn seven ploys to catch
thold a man, eight ways to please in bed
y love with them until you've played them out
heads must swim, till hearts of stone must spin
w flirt with eyebrows, now coquet with lips
w sing the moon, now sport among the flowers
you have it, our house s stock in trade:
1 itand be a mistress of our craft!
From first to last Kiều listened, learning
her eyebrows pursed, her face turned deadly pale
She felt such shame just hearing what was taught
What ironies the tides of life throw up! 1
A girl, wellborn and raised in her good home
now bound a prentice to this curious trade
How fast a face will harden, tanned by shame!
Can human life sink lower than her plight?
Alas for her, one gone astray and lost:
what could she do, held in a stranger s clutch?
Down came her curtains in the house of mirth:
high priced, her jade was all the more desired
Around the rose swarmed bees and butterflies
for nights of merriment, for months of spree 1
Birds flocked the branch, winds stirred the leaves she'd speed
some beau at dawn, wait for some spark at dusk
When, late at night, wine fumes had all cleared off
she'd start from sleep to sorrow for herself
Brocade had wrapped her, silk had sheltered her
now torn to shreds, the rose lay by the road
Poor callous face the wind and dew had tanned
Poor body bees and butterflies gorged on
Over her flesh let them all rage and storm
did she herself feel what they would call love? 1
| She'd hug a breeze or flowers, she'd watch snow
half hide the shades or moonlight spread around
But her own gloom would tinge each sight or scene:
when you feel grief, can what you see give joy?
She'd write some verse or paint, she'd pluck the lute )
by moonlight or play chess beneath the flowers
But such delights she feigned and did not feel:
who can you love when no one knows your heart?
Wind in bamboos, rain on plum trees she ignored:
a hundred cares beset a single soul
Her heart, evoking things long past or fresh
became a raveled skein, a mass of sores
She missed the two she owed nine debts, whose sun
was sinking day by day toward mulberry trees
Beyond the deep sunk streams and far flung hills
how could they guess what had become of her?
Of sophoras their yard had two, still young:
who now could take her place and tend their needs?
And she recalled her vow of deathless troth:
far, far away, did he know of her plight?
When he came home for her, the willow branch
had been snatched off and passed from hand to hand
She hoped his love could somehow be repaid:
was now the flower grafted on the bough?
All her emotions tangled like sleave silk
as dreams of home kept stirring sleep till dawn
From her gauze curtained window, at heaven's edge
alone, forlorn, she'd watch dusk follow dusk
While the moon hare and the sun crow whirled round
she mourned all victims in the Sortow League
They're given all the splendor of a rose
but they must pay for it in coin of grief
Doomed to a life of dust and storm, they'll drink
their cup of shame and odium to the dregs
Now, asa brothel patron, came a man:
Kỷ Tâm of the Thúc clan, a well read breed
He'd followed Father leaving Hai in Ch'ang
to open at Lin tzu a trading shop
Kiều s fame as queen of beauty had reached him
he called and left his card in her boudoir
Behind the tasseled drapes he faced the flower:
his fancy relished each of all her charms
The young camellia, shimmering on its stern
would glow still brighter with each fresh spring shower!
Man and girl, girl and man in fevered clasp:
on a spring night, how can one quell the heart?
Of course, when two kin spirits meet, one Lie
soon binds them in a knot none can yank Joose
They'd tryst and cling together night or day
What had begun as lust soon turned to love
It chanced that, by a stroke of timely luck
his father went away to journey home
And more bewitched than ever, our young man
would often see his darling these spring days
tOn wind swept balconies, in moon washed yards
they'd sip rare liquor, improvise linked verse
With incense burned at dawn, with tea at noon
they'd play chess games, perform duets on lutes
One dizzy round of pleasures caught them both
they knew each other's moods, grew more attached
A woman's charms, O wondrous tidal waves
that tumble homes and topple halls like toys!
Young Thúc, who squandered money with both hands
could spend his all on one seductive smile
The bawd would sleek Kigu s hair, would paint her faee
the stench of coins excites the blood with greed
For summer cuckoos cried beneath the moon:
above the wall pomegranates kindled fire
Now, in her chamber, at a leisured hour
she dropped the curtain for an orchid bath
Lo, such pure jade and such white ivory!
Her body stood as Heaven's masterwork
He gazed and gazed transported with delight
he sang his love and penned a T ang poem
Tim glad to know your sentiments, she said
Each word is pearl or jade, each line brocade
Clever or not, I owe you my reply
homesickness, though, gives thoughts that hold me back
My heart still dwells beneath those golden clouds
No answer will your poem get today
You're talking in the strangest way, he said
But are you not an offshoot from her stock?
More gloom now dimmed the sparkle of her eyes
the sense of her ill fate struck her with grief:
T'm just a flower fallen from its branch
and you're the butterfly that flits and flirts
No doubt, my lord keeps his own wedded wife:
why waste our brief few days on idle chat?
Since we have known each other, he replied
my heart has nursed for you a steadfast love
But if we plan to live as lifelong mates
I must retrace the stream to its own source
Lhumbly thank you for the thought, she said
But | fear snags on both your side and mine
If you have lingered in the house of mirth
you love this rose for its fair hue alone
Someday its bloom will fade, its scent will Fail
will you still keep for me a constant heart?
What's more, within the threshold of your home
a mistress is already wielding sway
Till now the marriage bond has tied you two:
another woman will divide your love
A drifting cloud, a floating fern, am T
to drain your fond affection from your spouse?
Should things go topsy turvy thanks to me
on whom will later fall high Heaven's scourge?
If with firm hand you hold the heim and steer
you may protect me, shield me, now and then
But if the lady lords it over you
I shall be tossed to her, your lioness
Under your roof I'll have to cringe and craw]
her vinegar will burn worse than hell's own fire!
Above your wife there is your father, too:
will he bestow some pity on this girl?
How can he love the rose picked off a wall?
He'll send the harlot back to harlotdom
With yet more dirt and filth T'll learn to live
but what I'm mindful of is your good name
If you love me, please keep our love intact
See that there's no loose end and I'll obey
He said: You speak with such a wary tongue!
Are they two strangers still, your heart and mine?
Think not of things as far as Wu or Laos:
depend on me to work all matters out
I'm near you do they count, all risks remote?
Tye sworn my troth T'll brave the winds and waves!
The two exchanged all secrets of their souls
pledging their troth in sight of sea and hills
The night was much too short for love refrains
the moon had sunk behind the western heights
He feigned to take Kiều out for some fresh air
among bamboos and hid her at a place
Now he prepared to wage both war and peace
seeking tacticians, asking help from spies
Then he sent word confronting that Dame Tú
she, outmaneuvered, could but sue for terms
He paid the ransom into her own hands
and notified the law of Kiều s release
Once he had settled with both laws and men
she soon escaped the circle of her woes
{As lovers joined their lives beneath one roof
their love grew deeper, deeper than the sea
Like fire and incense, mutual passion burned
her jade and lotus beauty gleamed and glowed
For half year they lived as intimates
Now, in the courtyard, planes mixed gold with jade
Along the hedge, frost hardy mums peeped out
And lo, the father came a riding back
He stormed and thundered in his towering wrath
filled with concern, he thought to split the pair
Determined, he passed judgment straightaway:
inher old whorehouse he'd put back the whore
The father s verdict was clear cut, forthright
yet, making bold, the son entreated him:
know my many crimes if thunđerbolts
or hatchet blows strike me, I'll die content
But now my hand has dipped in indigo:
a fool grown wise still can t undo what's done
Even if Thad her for just one day
who'd hold a lute and then rip off its strings?
Ifyou will not relent and grant me grace
Td rather lose my life than play her false
Those stubborn words aroused the old man bile
so at the hall of law he lodged complaint
Over a peaceful earth the waves now surged:
the prefect sent a warrant for the pair
They walked behind the sheriff, then at court
they fell upon their knees, still side by side
They raised their eyes and saw an iron mask
the prefect, strutting power, spoke harsh words:
Young wastrel, you have had your foolish fling
and she, that slut, is nothing but a cheat
A cast off rose with all its scent gone stale
she's put on rouge and powder, duping boors
To judge the state of things from his complaint
it's out of jomt with either one of you
1 shall uphold the law and try the case
There are two paths you're free to opt for which:
either TÌI mete out punishment by the book
or to the whorehouse I'll remand the whore
Once and for all my mind's made up! she cried
The spider s web shall not catch me again
Muddy or clear, it's still my life to live
1 shall endure the thunder of the law!
The judge declared: The law be carried out!
A peony in shackles, cuffs, and cangue
Resigned, she dared not cry her innocence
tears stained her cheeks and pain knit tight her brows
Down on a floor of dust and mud, her face
a tarnished glass, her frame a thin plum branch
Oh, poor young Thúc! Consider his sad plight:
he watched her from afar, his entrails torn
She suffers so because of me! he moaned
Had I but listened, she'd be spared this wrong
How ever can a shallow mind think deep?
So now I've caused her all this grief and shame
The judge had overheard young Thúc s lament
by pity moved, he asked for more details
At once the lover sobbed his story out
recounting all she'd said when he proposed:
She pondered what might happen, soon or late
aware that she herself could come to this
Because I chose to take it all in hand
T've brought this woe on her it s my own fault
The judge felt sorry when he heard those words
he smoothed his brow and figured some way out
If what you've told me is the truth, he said
this harlot, after all, knows right from wrong
Though just a lowly woman, Thúc went on
she s learned to ply the brush and scribble verse
But she must be perfection! laughed the judge
Well, write a piece, The Cangue, and strut your art
The girl complied she raised the brush and wrote
then laid the sheet of paper on his desk
It tops the height of T'ang! he cried in pr
All gold on earth can t buy her gifts and charms
The man of parts has met the woman fair:
a finer match could Chou and Ch en have bred?
Let s put an end to all this fight and feud
why sow discord and break a love duet?
When people come before a court of law
inside the rules of justice mercy dwells
Your son's own mate belongs within your clan:
forget your own displeasure and forgive
A wedding he decreed wind borne, took off
the bridal carriage, torches raced the stars
A band of piping flutes and throbbing drums
Jed bride and groom to their connubial niche
Old Thúc admired her virtues, prized her gifts
from him no more harsh word or stormy scene
Lilies and orchids bathed their home in scents
as bitter sorrow turned to sweeter love
Time flew amidst delights of wine or chess:
peach red had waned, now lotus green would wax
Behind their curtains, on a silent night
she felt misgivings, told him what she felt:
Since this frail girl found her support in you
geese followed swallows almost gone, a year
Yet not a day's brought news from your own home
With your new bride, you've cooled toward your old mate
It seems, upon reflection, rather odd:
from talk and gossip who could have saved us?
The mistress of your household so I've heard
does what is proper, says what is correct
Oh, how I dread all such uncommon souls!
It s hard to plumb the ocean s pits and depths
We've lived together for these full twelve months
from her we could not have concealed the fact
If for so long you've got no news of her
then something must be brewing in that hush
Now go back home immediately, I beg you:
you'll please her and we'll know what's in her mind
If you drag out this game of hide and seek
and put off telling her, it just won't work
He heard those words of counsel, said with calm
and braced himself to think of going home
Next day he spoke to Father of his plans
the old man, too, urged him to make the trip
To bid farewell and share the stirrup cup
they left their sweet love nest for Mount Kao t'ing
The Ch in stretched off a ribbon of pale blue
along the bank, some willows waved goodbye
They moaned, still holding hands they left untouched
the parting cup and choked on parting words
The hills and streams will sunder us, she said
But peace must reign at home to reign abroad
One sees a needle s eye if no red soarf
Blindfolded, who will try to catch a bir
A rather fragile bond now ties us two:
at home, spell it all out, make it all clear
Should she, displeased, object and raise a storm
tell her I know my place and honor hers
Far better thus than try to cover up
and only hatch more mischief afterwards
If you love me, remember what I say
A year is quite some time, but it will pass
To mourn this day, let's drain the parting eup
our cup of joy we'll drink twelve months from now
He climbed his horse, she let go of his gown
autumn was tinging maple woods with gloom
And off he rode as clouds of dust swirled up
to vanish past all those green mulberry groves
She walked back home to face the night alone
and by himself he fared the long, long way
Who split the lovers moon? Half stayed and slept
by her lone pillow, half lit his far road
Why tell what our wayfaring man went through?
Let's talk about the mistress of his hearth
Known as Miss Hoan, she wore a great clan name:
her father ruled the Civil Office Board
On happy winds of chance Thúc had met her
and they had tied the nuptial knot long since
Living above reproach, Miss Hoan could wield
the surest hand in catching one at fault
His garden boasted now a fresh blown rose
so she had heard from every mouth but his
The fire of wrath kept smoldering in her breast
against the knave whose fickle heart had roamed:
If only he'd confessed, told me the truth
Í might have favored her with my good grace
Td be a fool to lose my stately calm
and gain the stigma of a jealous shrew
But he s thought fit to pull his boyish prank
and hide his open secret what a farce!
He's fancied distance keeps me unaware
Let's hide and seek I too shall play his game
1 entertain no worry on this score:
the ant's inside the cup where ean it craw]?
Til make them loathe and shun each other's sight
Tilerush her so she cannot rear her head
Til rub the spectacle in his bare face
and make the traitor feel my iron hand
She locked her anger deep inside her heart
and let all rurnors breeze right past her ears
Later, two louts came bearing their report
hoping to earn due wages for their pains
The lady in high dudgeon thundered forth:
loathe pert knaves who'll weave, embroider things!
My husband's not a common, vulgar chur:
mouths with less truth than froth have spat this lie
She bade her lackeys execute her law
slapping their mouths and knocking out their teeth
An awestruck hush now settled on her house:
nobody risked another single peep
In her pink room she'd idle morn and eve
she'd chat and laugh as if naught were amiss
While in her bosom, night and day, she seethed
Jo, he came home, alighting from his horse
They spoke their joy, inquired each other's health
their love revived, theit ardor blazed again
Many a cup they drank to his return
but who could read what in their hearts each felt?
He had come home to sound his wife s intent
and, bit by bit, reveal the truth to her
Yet, gay or sober, as she talked and laughed
she would not drop one hint of his affair
So far I've kept my mouth shut tight, he thought
Why should I'squeal when no one s sticking me?
He wavered, shilly shallied all the while
afraid to pull a vine and shake the woods
At times, as back and forth they bandied jokes
the lady would let fall some vague remark:
True love sorts jade from stone and gold from brass:
between us two has grown a perfect trust
Praise be to all those tongues which spin long yarns
they've peddled tales of your so called amours
Had reason failed me, I'd have fouled my mind
believing them, become ä laughingstock
Since she put it in casual, bantering tones
he played along to parry blows and thrusts
They dallied, blending shadows by the lamp
or snugeling cheek to cheek beneath the moon
To perch and fish cress he'd begun to take
when down the well planes dropped a few gold leaves
His soul recalled the world beyond the pass
where for four seasons he had loved and lived
Before he could make bold to breathe a word
the lady guessed his mind and offhand said:
A year has gone since you lefl those white clouds:
regain Lin tau and care for your old sire
Her words unknit a knot within his breast!
His horse flew him across strange streams and hills:
waters, all gleaming, mirrors for the sky
walls wreathed in sapphire mist, peaks gilt with sun
The moment he had cracked his whip and left
she boarded her own coach to see her kin
Chapter and verse, she told her mother all
how he ở played false and how she'd borne her wrong:
A jealous tantrum's like an itch, I thought:
it shames the man, it earns the wife no praise
So T kept mum and looked the other way
but already had my plan laid down
By land it takes a month to reach Lin tzu
by sea, though, one will get there soon enough
ve picked some trusted lads to man a boat
go there and bring her back, with feet in chains
Then I'll drive her out of her mind and wits
TT torture her for all the world to see
First I'll discharge my spite on both, and next
Til make of both a mockery for all time
A master scheme, her mother praised the plot
she humored her and left her free to act
A vessel was rigged up with sails and yards:
two lackeys, Hound and Hawk, recruited thugs
After the crew was told what they should do
before the wind the boat set sail for CHỈ
As Kiều sat by her window, all alone
mixed threads of gloom ran crisscross in her soul
Their sun is setting, hanging at head's height
have they warm clothes, do they eat well or il?
The hair I clipped has reached my shoulders now:
what has become of all my vows of troth?
A clinging ivy thats my humble lot:
vill Heaven bless or curse this marriage tie?
Why have all wrongs and woes befallen me?
Oh, to live safe like Ch ang o in her hall!
An autumn night through windows wafts of breeze:
high in the sky, a crescent moon, three stars
To Heaven's altar she brought incense sticks
She was still pouring out her heart in prayer
when from the shrubs a wicked band sprang out
and screamed like devils spewed by hell itself
The courtyard was all gleaming with drawn swords
Frightened, she still knew not what was afoot
On her they sprayed a drug inducing drowse
which left her senseless, slumbering in a dream
They picked her up, placed her astride a horse
then set on fire his library, her own room
Beside the river lay a corpse, unclaimed:
they dragged it in, left it there in her stead
The servants, from whom terror had chased wits
sought cover dashing into shrubs and groves
Old Thúc, whose house was in the neighborhood
was struck with panic seeing flames shoot up
Master and men all hurried to the spot
to quench the roaring blaze and search for Kiều
As rose the wind, so higher rose the flames
The servants looked and looked of her no trace
Wild eyed and frenzied, they all scuttled round
to peer at random into shrubs and wells
They fought their way and reached her inner room:
they saw a heap of cinders, bones charred black
Meaning no evil, who suspects foul play
They took it to be Kiều and no one else
Old Thúc broke into: sobs and tears he mourned
the virtuous mate his absent son had Lost
He had the ashes gathered and brought home
then shrouded, coffined, and consigned to earth
All funeral rites for Kiều had been performed
when overland, at length, young Thúc came back
Where they'd hummed verse he now stepped in to find
a pile of cinders, four rain beaten walls
He rushed to Father s place in the middle room
an altar had her tablet set thereon
Alas, the tragedy he was told in full
Love tore his heart and anguish burned his soul
He rolled upon the ground, he wept and moaned:
That death for such a woman, what a wrong!
1 was so sure we two would meet again
who could have known we said adieu for good?
Love wakened thoughts, and thoughts aroused more pain
who could stamp out his sorraw, quench his grief?
He learned that near those parts a shaman lived
who summoned spirits knowing their dark realm
On the Three Isles or down by the Nine Springs
he'd trace the whereabouts of all dead souls
Young Thức sent gifts and called the psychic in:
he bade him look for her, inquire her fate
Before the altar, down the shaman knelt
He kindled incense sticks, fell into trance
When he revived, he made a clear report:
I did not see her face but learned her fate
A karma of dine woe still weighs on her
with debts unpaid, how can she die as yet?
Her star does indicate she's in distress
but you must wait a year for news of her
And when you two stand face to face again
how strange, you will avoid each other's eyes!
When Thúc was told so weird a prophecy
dared he believe such tidings of her fate?
It was rank hocus pocus, nothing more
Where could he hope to see her in this world?
He mourned his flower, bewailed their joys of spring:
how often does one meet a nymph on earth?
The fallen rose had washed downstream, he thought
he knew not she had found her hell on earth
Once Hound and Hawk had brought their scheme to pass
they carried Kiều aboard and laid her down
And then, all sails unfurled and halyards taut
the skiff raced forth and crossed the waves for Hại
They landed, made straight for the palace where
they turned Kiều in to earn their due reward
To servants quarters she was carried off
while she still lay unconscious, deep in sleep
Then, with a jolt, she wakened from her drowse
ther home had vanished whose mansion was this here?
Half conscious, half asleep, she fumbled yet
when a loud call came from the audience room
Housemaids rushed up to urge her prompt response
in mortal dread, she followed one of them
Her eyes glanced up and saw a stately hall
inscribed above: Heaven's Prime Minister
And candles burned in broad day, right and left
There on a couch a lady sat enthroned
She queried Kiều, she probed her, root and branch
Kiều dutifully answered, told her life
A storm of fury burst upon her head:
Bút you're one of those vagabonds past all shame!
This wench is no good, decent woman, no!
She must have fled her man, if not her lord
A graveyard cat! A hen that prowls the fields!
You hemmed and hawed and could not clear yourself
Tve bought you soul and body you're my slave
andl yet such airs and graces you display!
Where are you lasses who enforce my law?
Teach her a lesson deal her thirty strokes!
Yes, Ma am! all housemaids cried A hundred tongues
could not have helped poor Kiều defend herself
Sticks of bamboo belabored her whose flesh
would not break up, whose heart would fail to quake?
Pity a spray of peach, a sprig of plum
once more exposed to storm and torn to shreds
Flower, the slave renamed by order, Kigu
was now impressed to toil as lady's maid
She joined the ranks of servants garbed in blue
with hair unkempt and skin as dull as lead
Among the servants there, a stewardess
observing Kiéu s sweet ways, befriended her
She'd give Kiều tea or medicine for her wounds
and some advice on how to stay alive:
Accept whatever happens, good or ill
a reed, though, should take care of its Frail self
Perhaps you must atone for some past sin
but malice brought you here, and not pure chance
Beware around here walls have ears and eyes
Ifyou see your old friend, you look away
or lightning bolts will strike you from the blue
When wronged, can flies and ants demand redress?
Her tears, like pearls, kept rolling down Kiều s cheeks
foreboding brewed and stirred within her soul
Tve had an ample share of life's foul dust
and now this swamp of mud proves twice as vile
Will fortune never let its victims go
but in its snares and toils hold fast a rose?
| sinned in some past life and have to pay:
TI pay as lowers must fade and jade must break
While Kiều was taking refuge there for now
one day Miss Hoan came home to see her folks
Mother and daughter talked of this and that
and then the lady sent for Kiều to say
My daughter needs a slave to serve her wants:
Tllet you go and be her chambermaid
Kiều followed her new mistress and set out
bound for what hell or heaven she knew not
Now, day or night, on hand with combs and towels
she'd stand at beck and call, a model slave
One evening, all was calm the mistress asked
to hear Kiều play the lute, her love of yore
She did as bid, plucked strings and spilled such drops
of music as poured liquor in the soul
The lady seemed to like the lutanist s art:
her stern expression softened just a bit
Within a stranger's gate Kiều slaved and lived
confiding in her shadow or her heart
To meet her Lin tzu spouse again, she thought
she'd have to wait until some future life
All heaven was one white expanse of clouds
she peered far into space: where was her home?
While months reeled on with worries close at hand
could Thúc suspect what happened far away?
Since from Lin tzu his lovebird had flown off
an empty chamber kept a lonesome man
He saw her eyebrow in the crescent moon
breathed hints of old perfume and ached for her
Just as the lotus wilts, the mums bloom forth
time softens grief, and winter turns to spring
Where could he find her he had once so loved?
He called it fate and duller throbbed his pain
Nostalgia woke some yearning in his breast
and, sick for home, he made his long way back
She met him at the gate, she gushed with joy
Once they had traded news of health and such
she had all drapes rolled up; then she bade Kiều
appear and greet the lord on his return
As Kiều came out, she faltered at each step
for from a distance she perceived the truth:
Unless the sun and lights have tricked my eyes
who else but my own Thic is sitting there?
So now I must confront the blatant Fact
beyond all doubt, she s caught me in her trap
Could such a hellish plot be hatched on earth?
Why has mankind so erred and bred a fiend?
As bride and groom we two were duly joined
she splits us into slave and master now
The face displays sweet smiles, but deep inside
the heart will scheme to kill without a knife
We stand as far apart as sky and earth:
alas, what now to say, what now to do?
She grew bewildered gazing at his face
her heart a raveled knot of silken threads
Too awed to disobey, she bowed her head
and prostrated herself upon the floor
The husband was dismayed, at his wits end:
ˆ'Woe's me! But isn t she right here, my Kiều?
What cause or reason led her to this plight?
Alas, we're caught and I know by whose hands!
Lest he'd betray himself, he'd breathe no word
bbut could not stop his tears from spilling out
His lady fixed him with a glare and asked:
You just came home why look so woebegone?
T just took off my mourning, answered he
Tthink of my lost mother and still grieve
She sang his praises: What a loving son!
Let s drink to your return, drown autumn gloom
Husband and wife exchanged repeated toasts
while Kiều stood by and from the bottle poured
The lady would berate her, finding fault
would make her kneel and offer up each drink
He'd act like one demented more and more
as tears kept flowing while the liquor ebbed
Averting eyes, he'd talk and laugh by fits:
then, pleading drunk, he'd try a safe retreat
You slave, the lady snapped, persuade the lord
to drain his cup or I shall have you thrashed
Grief bruised his vitals, panic struck his soul
he took the proffered cup and quafTed the gall
The lady talked and laughed as though half drunk
to crown the evening, she devised a sport
She said: That slave has mastered all the arts
she'll play the lute, treat you to some good piece
All dizzied, in a daze, Kiêu bowed and sat
before the thin gauze screen to tune the lute
Four strings together seemed to ery and moan
in tones that wrenched him who was feasting there
Both heard the selfsame voice of silk and wood
she smiled and gloated while he wept within
When he could check his welling tears no more
he stooped his head and tried to wipe them off
Again the mistress shouted at the slave:
Why play that doleful tune and Kill our joy?
Don t you give thought to anything you do?
Tl punish you if you distress the lord
He waxed more frantic still to lay the storm
he'd hurriedly attempt a laugh, a grin
The waterclock now marked the night's third watch
the lady eyed their faces, looking pleased
She gloried in her soul: This sweet revenge
makes up for grief that festered in my breast
But shrunk with shame and choked with rage inside
he nursed a wound that rankled more and more
To share one pillow they regained their niche
Kiều huddled by her lamp, awake all night:
So now she has unveiled her own true face
How weird, that jealous humor in her blood!
To split two lovebirds, she contrived it all
she'd part and tear us from each other's eyes
Now we're a gulf, a world apart she s all
Tm nothing now; she s always right, I'm wrong
So gently it holds us, her irom hand!
How can we struggle free and save our love?
Frail woman that I was, Ï tripped and fell:
shall I be rescued whole from furious waves?
Alone, she brooded far into the night
as ebbed the lampion s oil, her tears still flowed
Kiều served there day and night Once, face to face
the mistress asked the servant how she fared
She chose her words with care, gave this reply:
I sometimes sorrow for my lot in life
The lady turned to Thúc, requesting him:
0 Please grill the slave, pry loose the facts from her
He felt all torn and rent within his heart
for he could not confess nor bear the scene
Afraid he'd draw more outrage on her head
he ventured, in soft tones, to question her
s Head bowed, the girl knelt down upon the floor
and of her past wrote out a brief account
Submitted to the lady, it was read
it seemed to touch some chord inside her heart
Forthwith she handed it to him and said:
We should admire her gifts, deplore her woes
Had fortune favored her with wealth and rank
she could have graced a palace cast in gold
A woman bobs upon the sea of life:
so blessed with talent, yet so cursed by fate!
Indeed, you speak the utter truth, he said
Misfortune s never spared a single rose
The rule has held since ages out of mind
show mercy, treat her with a gentler hand
The lady said: In her report she begged
a to make her home within the Void's great gate
Well, II be pleased to grant her that one wish
and help her break the cycle of her woes
There in our garden is the Kuan yin shrine
with everblooming lotus, tall bo tree
5 with many plants and flowers, rocks and pools:
let her go there to tend the shrine and pra:
The dawn's first glow was glimmering im the skies
they bore five offerings incense, flowers, and such
led Kigu to Buddha's temple: there she pledged
to live by all three vows and five commands
For a cassock she doffed the slave's blue smock
and as a nun she now was called Pure Spring
She was to light the temple morn and eve
while Spring and Autumn served as altar maids
3 So Kiều took refuge in the garden, near
the Purple Grove, far from the world s red dust
What could she still expect of human ties?
Now she was spared one shame to sell her charms
At Buddha's feet she buried griefs by day
she'd copy texts, light incense up at night
magic drops from Kuan yin's willow branch!
They quench lust s fire, wash earthly filth away
Since she put on a nun s drab brown attire
the autumn moon had crossed the zenith twice
Behind barred doors, inside a close meshed net
she talked in people's presence, wept unseen
Here stood the shrine and there his study lay:
though gate to gate, they were two worlds apart
While he was sighing, moaning deep within
one day his wife went visiting her folks
Chance beckoned he slipped out and walked straight on
to reach the garden shrine and meet his love
He cried his anguish bursting into sobs
and teardrops soaked the flap of his blue gown:
Tmust admit I have betrayed our troth
and let you singly shoulder all our woes
Outwitied by a woman, I've looked on
heartsick and at a loss to tell the truth
Through my own fault you've come to grief pure jade
is mired in dirt, a life lost in its spring
Ob, I would brave all perils and all risks
to stay with you, in death if not in life
But to my forebears Ï still owe an heir
Til clench my teeth and cut our bond in two
T break my vow could my next hundred lives
redeem the shame of one pledged word unkept?
She said: A small, frail skiff that rides the waves
may float or sink as fortune will dictate
While I was floundering in the swamp of vi
how could 1 ever hope to live till now?
It is my part to play a drop of rain
that falls at random as spectators watch
But lute and strings did come together once
wedded for some scant days if not for life
Please find me some safe exit from this cage:
you'll prove your love and earn my gratitude
Te nursed that thought in secret, he replied
How can one gauge a human heart's abyss?
Hear that, if and when a storm breaks out
it will wreak harm on you and grief on me
Try for your freedom run or fly away!
Our love has had its time this is the end
We two shall soon be traveling opposite paths:
when might we meet and pledge our troth anew?
Rocks crumble, streams run dry a silkworm, dead
still clings on to the strand of silk it s spun
The past, the future both discussed at length
they talked and talked, undrained of tender words
Eyes locked, hands clasped, the lovers would not part
but from afar a housemaid flashed a cue
He swallowed down his shame and made to leave
in stalked the lady brushing flowers aside
All honey and all smiles, she greeted him
and asked: So, have you come here for a walk?
He groped for some excuse: While gathering flowers
I stopped to watch her copy sacred texts
Such exquisite brush strokes! she cried in praise
Lan t ng engravings hardly excel them!
Alas, by life's strong tides she s tossed about
a talent worth pure gold a thousand coins!
Both drank a Dhyana brew, red plum wood tea;
then, strolling, they regained their book lined room
Kigu s gloom and dread increased under her breath
she asked the housemaid what had taken place
The housemaid said: She was here all the while
she stood on tiptoe spying half an hour
She saw it all, missed not one bit or shred
heard every word, and learned the full, whole truth:
all your sore trials, all your dire ordeals
the master s fits of grief, your own laments
She bade me wait there standing to one side
she got her earful, then she went upstairs
Kiều heard and felt cold terror in her soul:
ll never look upon her like again
That was true self command, that was pure sham
The merest thought of her will make flesh creep
Where else to find a woman of such depths?
No wonder Thúc now lies bound hand and foot
When she caught us together, any wife
would in a jealous rage have scowled and snarled
But no, she made no trouble, kept her calm
she greeted with good cheer, she sweetly talked
An angry face reveals what stirs the heart
but deep and mean are those who hate and smile
My life I must take into my own hands
beware a tiger's jaws, a serpent's fangs
Unless I grow my wings and fly, some day
she'll nip the blossom off the tree she's hedged
A floating fern minds not the swift, strong stream
destined to drift, it drifts no matter where
But how, alone and lost on strangers soil
shall I fight cold and hunger with bare hands?
Thoughts scurried back and forth and then she saw
some altar objects, gold or silver things:
she grabbed a few, hid them inside her dress
As she heard drumbeats sound the night's third watch
she heaved herself and climbed across the wall
then westward picked her way in moonset dusk
Through wooded hills, sand trails immersed in mist;
cockcrow from moon lit huts; fresh marks of shoes
on dew soaked bridge Along the path, at night
a girl braved wind and weather walking on
The eastern sky glowed up, lit mulberry groves
forlorn, Kiều knew not where to find a home
Then, in the distance, loomed a Buddhist church
she read the sign: Retreat of Blessed Peace
She made straight for the entrance gate and knocked
a nun heard her, came out, and let her in
On seeing Kiéu in plain monastic garb
Giác Duyên, kind hearted prioress, liked the girl
She asked about her past from root to top
yet feeling strange, Kiều skirted round the truth
This humble nun s a native of Peking
who's lived by Buddha's teaching for some time
Later, my prioress in her turn will come
but she told me to bring you these two gifts
She took them out and showed a golden bell
a silver gong she'd hỉdden on herself
The prioress cast an absent glance and said
So you've come from Hang Thúy, my good old friend?
It worries me to see you trek alone
stay here a day or two till she arrives
Kigu made a home of that small cloud locked church
living on salt and greens in carefree days
She'd chant old sutras she had learned by heart
tend incense burners, tidy rooms and cells
handle palm leaves, fly banners in the clouds
light lamps at moonrise, ring the bell at dawn
The prioress found her mind above the norm
highly regarded, Kiều felt more secure
Now spring was ending flowers cast their shades
on earth, the Silver River crossed the sky
No wind, no cloud, a time of leisured ease~
a pilgrim came to worship at the shrine
Admiring both the gong and bell, she said:
But they look like the property of Miss Hoan!
Giác Duyên was truly worried by those words
in the still night, she queried Kiều again
Kiều could no longer keep her secret dark:
from top to bottom she retold her past
She added: Now that things have come this far
my weal or woe lies solely in your hands
When she had heard Kiéu s tale, the nun grew faint
teetering between plain pity and dire dread
She whispered in Kiều 's ear and spoke her heart:
The Buddha s gate is open wide to all
But things I can t foresee are what I dread
Td sorely grieve if something struck you here
Plan far ahead and flee you'd be unwise
to sit and wait till waters reach your feet
Some people surnamed Bac lived nearby there
avi camel Ni Meee in i SEZS<:
They were sent for, advised of all the facts
and asked to shelter Kiều beneath their roof
Too glad to find a haven, Kiều rushed in
how could she stop to reckon distant risks
suspect another lurking nest of thieves?
Dame Bạc soon proved a colleague of Dame Tủ
She crowed within at Kigu's unpainted charms:
she'd gotten what should yield a fat return
Out of thin air she would concoct her tales
and hold the girl on tenterhooks of fear
Repeating she would turn her out of doors
she hurled dark threats to force a man on her:
Ten thousand miles from home you're all alone
and all around you've spread a nasty name
You cursed breed, you will yet wreck our home
who else but us would dare to harbor you?
Grab the first chance you have and tie the knot
or fly and hide in heaven if you can
Well, in these parts no match can be arranged
nor is there any prospect farther off
But there s Bac Hạnh, a nephew dear to me
my blood relation, not just any man
He owns and runs a trading shop in Tai:
there's none as honest never breaks his word
Listen to me and marry him you must
Once wedded, you can move with him to Tai
Who'll recognize you there? At large and free
you'll rove the streams and seas just as you wish
If you refuse to give me your consent
you'll go against my wish and come to grief
Care knit Kiều s brows, gloom overcast ber face
the more she heard, the more it hurt like blows
She'd stumbled, falling where she could not fee
at bay, the quarry vented her despair:
I'm just a swallow strayed far from its flock
once wounded by a bow, it fears curved boughs
If, cornered, I must wed and serve a man
how do I know him, know his face, his heart?
