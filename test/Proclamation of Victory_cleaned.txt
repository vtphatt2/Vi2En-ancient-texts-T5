 In the name of Heaven, I (King Lê Lợi) hold the belief that compassion and righteousness are intended to bring peace and when troops are dispatched to protect the population, their primary mission is to suppress tyranny.
 As to Đại Việt,  a country of great culture with a long tradition, its mountains and rivers are lawfully delineated.
 In addition, our customs are different from those in the North.
 For hundreds of years, the dynasties of Triệu, Đinh, Lý and Trần had firmly established their independence.
 Like the Han, Tang, Song and Yuan of China they proudly governed their lands.
 Although their strength, their weakness and ours at times differed, men of noble character in our country were never in short supply.
 As a result, Liu Kung,  too greedy, was defeated; Zhao Jie,  too ambitious, was killed;
 Suo Du  was captured alive at Hàm Tử Port; and Wu Ma  died at Bạch Đằng Sea. 
 These were irrefutable facts that were clearly recorded in history.
 Then, the Hồ family with their corrupt policies spurred anger and resentment among the populace.
 Taking advantage of this opportunity, a barbaric Ming army invaded and caused havoc in our country.
 Worse even were traitors who sold out the country for their personal gain.
 They burnt poor citizens under the flames of hell and buried newborn in caves of terror.
 They deceived Heaven and duped our people, using all sort of guiles.
 They started warfare, causing bitterness and ill will for two decades.
 Without mercy and justice, they plundered the land and robbed our resources.
 They levied heavy taxes to impoverish the whole nation.
 Divers were forced to dive deep to look for pearls amidst danger of attack by sharks and alligators.
 Miners were led into forested mountains to sieve sand for gold, risked being infected with debilitating diseases.
 With forced labour, they cast nets everywhere to catch kingfishers  and set up snares to trap black deer.
 They spared nothing even the little creatures or grasses.
 Nor did they leave those in distress alone.
 They bared their teeth, opened wide their mouths to suck blood to satisfy their insatiable thirst.
 They were building palaces after palaces that required an endless number of skilled workers and conscripts.
 They drafted young men and women from our villages to meet their demand, leaving no one to attend to badly needed planting and weaving work.
 Bamboo of the Southern Mountain did not suffice to count their crimes.
 So filthy were their acts that the water of the Eastern Sea was not enough to wash off the smell.
 I rose from the mountains of Lam Sơn to lead the struggle, hiding in the backwoods.
 So angry with the enemy that I felt I could not share with them the same world.
 I hated the enemy so much that I swore not to co-exist with them.
 For more than ten years, I had had so much sufferings and headache.
 Lying on thorns and tasting gall, I did it for not only one day. 
 So angry I forgot to eat, valuable time was devoted to digesting war strategy manuals.
 Studying the past, I discovered the reasons for the rise and fall of nations.
 In many sleepless nights, I dreamt of a day our nation would be saved from the cruel tyrants.
 When I raised the flag of salvation, it was the time the enemy’s strength was at its highest.
 Unfortunately, on our side men of character were like the morning stars; and men of talent were like green leaves in autumn.
 For daily chores, helping hands were in great need.
 In strategy discussion, there were few able souls around to consult.
 My goal at all times was to march towards the Eastern Capital. 
 Meanwhile, on my left, a chair was always available to receive a top official. 
 But, the more I tried to look for the man, the more I found it to be difficult.
 I alone was to carry out the mission, rushing as to save a drowning person.
 I was so upset for not being able to kill the entire enemy.
 Meanwhile, I was worrying about the dire situation the country was in.
 For weeks, foods at Linh Sơn were running out.
 Soldiers at Khôi Huyện at a time were reduced to less than five hundred.
 Perhaps Heaven was testing my commitment.
 Thus, the more I had to overcome the difficulties.
 As brothers, people from the four corners of the nation joined me to hoist the bamboo flags.
 Soldiers of all ranks like fathers and sons drank mixed drinks from river water.
 When to fight with a small number against a larger one, ambush was the tactic.
 When fighting with a weak force against a strong one, surprise attack was to be used.
 In short, just cause always prevails over tyranny; compassion is the virtue to embrace in place of violence.
 The battle of Bồ Đằng was like a thunderstorm full of blinding lightning.
 The encounter at Trà Lân resembled a bamboo forest that had been slashed and put to fire.
 Our soldiers’s spirits were heightened.
 Our military might was now earning well-deserved respect.
 Chen Zhi  and Shan Shou  were scared out of their wits at the bad news.
 Li An  and Fang Zheng  were holding their breath, hoping to escape capture.
 Victory after victory, we followed them in pursuit to take the Western Capital.
 More troops were mobilized; we recovered our beloved Eastern Capital.
 At Ninh Kiều, blood flowed like a river, as the stench was spreading for miles.
 At Tuïy Ñoäng, dead bodies piled up in the open fields, such an infamy that will never be forgotten.
 Chen Qia,  the enemy’s brains, was beheaded.
 Li Liang,  a blood-sucking mandarin, also lost his life.
 Wang Tong,  who was sent to reinforce the legion, caused the war to be more intense.
 Ma Ying,  who led a rescue effort, raised our fighting spirit even higher.
 Besieged and exhausted, they had no choice but surrendered.
 With a superior stratagem and a humane policy, we defeated the enemy without much effort.
 I had thought that they would change their mind and ambition.
 Instead, they were secretly plotting further aggression, inviting death and destruction on themselves.
 Because of the stubborn idea of one person, calamities befell on thousands of others.
 He might have enjoyed a momentous fame, but made himself a laughing stock to the world. 
 Thus, they urged the baby Xuan De  to mobilize for war.
 He sent two bashful generals, Mu Sheng  and Liu Sheng , to add fuel to the fire.
 In the ninth month of Đinh Mùi (1427), Liu Sheng with his troops entered from Qiu Wen. 
 In the tenth month of the same year, Mu Sheng took another road to approach from Yunnan. 
 In anticipation of the moves, we set up defenses at critical locations to stop the advance units.
 At the same time, troops were sent to cut off their supply lines to starve them.
 On the eighteenth, we foiled Liu Sheng at Chi Lăng.
 On the twentieth, he was beheaded at Mã Yên.
 On the twenty-fifth, Lord Liang Ming  was killed on the battlefield.
 On the twenty-eighth, Minister Li Qing  committed suicide when there was no other way to escape.
 Having an upper hand, we struck hard at the enemy.
 Checked at both ends, hopeless the enemy turned around to attack one another.
 More troops arrived to surround the fortresses.
 The Middle of October was the day of general assault.
 Brave soldiers voluntarily lined up; talented generals were all prepared.
 Mountain stones wore off as swords were sharpened on them.
  Rivers were drying when elephants scooped up water.
 At first drum, sea-monsters disappeared; at second drum, vultures were driven off.
 Little ants scattered as great dikes broke; strong winds blew off all dry leaves.
 Commander Cui Ju  dropped on his knees to beg for pardon.
 Minister Huang Fu,  who himself had his hands tied, surrendered.
 At Lạng Giang and Lạng Sơn, corpses were strewn all over.
 At Xương Giang and Bình Than, rivers were reddened with blood.
 The sky was gloomily overcast.
 So saddened, the moon and sun turned dim.
 The column that came by way of Yunnan was stunned when blocked at Li Hua,  the entry port.
 Mu Sheng troops broke up and ran for their lives when informed of Liu Sheng being defeated at Cần Trạm.
 Lãnh Câu brook was full of blood, its water ringing the moaning of wandering souls.
 At Đan Xá fortress, dead bodies piled up like mountains; its plain was covered with blood that had been darkened.
 The two rescue columns were completely wiped out.
 Soldiers at besieged fortresses took off their uniforms to turn themselves in.
 We took rebel generals prisoners, who like hungry tigers wagged tails begging for lives.
 The Mighty God did not kill, I bestowed upon them mercy.
 I provided Ma Qi  and Fang Zheng with five hundred boats, who when reaching the sea were still like in a daze.
 Wang Tong and Ma Ying were given some thousand horses to repatriate and as they were leaving their hearts were still beating fast and their legs still trembling.
 They coveted life and feared death, wishing for peace.
 I chose to nourish our troops and permit our people to have more time to recover.
 This ought to be a right and wise course of action, which was unprecedented.
 From now on, our nation will be stronger and more resolute.
 The citizens will see a new life of prosperity.
 The affairs of a nation often go through a period of ebb and flow
 The sun and the moon naturally go dark and then shine again.
 The humiliation of a thousand years has now been redressed.
 It is now time for the nation to enjoy peace and prosperity.
 We owed this to the blessing of Heaven and our revered ancestors.
 Oh! A single sword brought success and glory. 
 Victory is here to celebrate for thousands of years.
 Peace prevails throughout the nation.
 Reform is hereby solemnly proclaimed to all four corners of the nation.
