If by mistake you sleep with someone’s wife, 
you’ll be sent down the river on a raft!” 
But all her words were wasted on his ears, 
as he kept thinking of the youthful mouse.       
He wished to see her once again at least 
and thus assuage his longing, his desire. 
If destiny had not meant her for him, 
why had an accident brought her his way? 
Lost in a daze, he yearned and pined, eyes glazed 
and staring like a shaman’s slaughtered pig. 
His wife thought him bewitched; he’d eaten up 
some magic dish concocted by the mouse! 
The lovelorn rat would walk about and moon. 
His wife fed him a stew of eel and herbs— 
she hoped to break the mouse’s spell on him 
and bid his wayward soul come home to her. 
The rat, though, was past cure
no crab will leave its hole and go to Heaven as you wish.” 
“An eel I’m holding by the tail,” she thought. 
“I can’t divorce him on these flimsy grounds. 
The suspect will deny the plaintiff's charge— 
how can I prove what I accuse him of? 
He may abscond and scamper to the woods— 
who’ll make him pay his alimony then? 
No corpus delicti can I bring to bear— 
I lack a case to have my day in court.” 
She raised an uproar, grilling him again: 
“The rat has hid his head but shown his tail! 
You still crave tender meat and fancy rice, 
and you won’t touch the homey fare I cook. 
‘He changes wives who’s risen in the world.’ 
This woman will not beg you for your love. 
A doddering wife should be left on the shelf— 
who cares for sagging breasts and shrunken frame?
None likes to eat ripe eggplant or old squash, 
and I’m well past my prime, along in years.
When there’s a moon, the lamp will be ignored.’ 
They love what’s piping hot, though badly cooked.        
I laugh so hard that I shed tears of shame. 
Praise him who coined this adage in times past: 
‘While she still has her looks, they pay her court. 
Her looks once gone, they leave her all forlorn.’? 
What’s new and fresh is cherished by the world— 
an owl cannot compete against a nymph. 
Send this old, leaky pot back to South Bridge” 
and spare her more hard work, more toil and moil.
No more will she drag home a heavy egg?! 
or bustle like a gammer fighting bees.” 
A sand crab carries sand, to no avail.? 
Raised by a wasp, a spider gives no thanks.” 
“The words you say sound rather strange,” he said, 
“though it’s a woman’s knack to nag and scold: 
their sting is worse than lemon juice fresh squeezed. 
Your ivy shall not conquer my whole tree. 
Am I a weakling you can push around? 
I’m not a man whose mustache wilts and droops! 
I’ve always tried to live and let you live, 
but more and more you’re baring your true face. 
I’ve hung my head and let you tweak my beard. 
I’ve chafed and seethed just like a cooped-up horse. 
A donkey’s used to blows and kicks, but stop?’ 
your endless nagging, pick on me no more!” 
She thereupon burst out in furious screams 
and rolling up her sleeves, made for the door. 
“Together since we were dirt-poor,” she said, 
“we two should have evolved strong, binding ties. 
Instead, it now turns into this fine mess. 
Well, I shall clean it up for good and all!” 
Sighing and moaning, she betook herself 
to that east neighborhood where lived the mouse. 
Now she approached the mousehole—finding her,          
she heaped abuse and insults on her head. 
The mouse turned purple with both shame and ire. 
“How dare you, ma’am, insult me here?” she asked. 
“You do not know my mettle, yet you dare 
call me these names; for that you'll surely pay!” 
Sauntering around a corner of the wall, 
a cat came up to arbitrate the fight. 
Both parties, frightened quite out of their wits, 
hopped knolls and hurdled hills to scamper off. 
The flustered she-rat fell into a pond: 
was Heaven, dispensing justice, far away? 
But the white mouse got home without a hitch: 
she reached her gate and gladly scurried through.
As Heaven’s retribution dealt the blow, 
our scholar  was watching by the wall. 
He saw the she-rat thrashing in the pond— 
on shore, the cat was waiting with a grin. 
Ho waved the feline off—then, wading in, 
he fished the rat out of the duckweed pond. 
Her hair dried out, she soon regained her wits 
and with bowed head, she meekly told her tale: 
“T am a fool—neglected by my rat, 
I traveled to these parts and met with woe. 
I’m grateful that you saved my humble life— 
how can I value your kind deed enough? 
I owe it to your large and noble heart— 
Heaven will not forget a virtuous man.” 
“Such havoc jealous mates may wreak!” said Ho. 
“You pull and tug too hard—the string must snap.” 
Let me tell you what happened, make it clear. 
At midnight that white mouse went hunting food. 
Chased by a dog, she took her refuge here, 
ready to leave once danger was no more. 
As he found such a beauty in his hole,       
was it so strange he made a play for her? 
But he ran up against a constant wife— 
his wooing got him nowhere, so he quit. 
Then home you came—unwitting, you gnashed teeth, 
and jealousy made you say vicious things. 
The merciful Buddha, let alone your rat, 
would have been angered by what you said then. 
Well, think it over: whose fault was this mess? 
You suffer for your act—blame no one else. 
So used to braving streams and daring cats, 
you challenged that white mouse in her own den. 
You have cast ignominy on all your sex, 
contemning faithful wives—is it no so?” 
She listened, learning what had taken place. 
“Thank you—you’ve let me know the facts,” she said. 
“What I said then I now recall with shame. 
The moon has waned—how can I make it wax? 
A fit of anger made me lose my wits??— 
now can remorse undo what then was done?”! 
The scholar chose his words, consoling her 
and counseling her in every way he could: 
“It’s you who brought this down upon yourself. 
Go back and sweet-talk him to calm his wrath. 
If you want peace and quiet in your home, 
the best’s to get along, agree and live. 
Who ever wears a shirt above the head?!! 
Why not think matters through before you act? 
Conjugal love, how much it means and weighs! 
Is marriage but a short-lived, one-day thing? 
Stay out of strife—know heaven here on earth. 
The meek and mild shall outlive shrews and brutes. 
Woman and man have shared one mat, one bed— 
how often should a spider spin its silk?!? 
Mull over every action like a move at chess—         
using your head, do nothing in excess. 
Don’t pick a quarrel—poke at weeds or tares 
and bugs come out to stink your household up. 
A woman’s like a raindrop—where she falls 
there she’s to stay: she’ll know no better place.! 
However sore or furious he may be, 
contain yourself and soothe him with soft pleas. 
Spare one harsh word and earn nine words of love!— 
never presume on what you’ve done for him. 
Thus you'll fulfill a wife’s submissive role: 
yield to the man and you’ll get your own way.! 
When your cooked rice tastes bland and soup lacks spice,! 
the world will sneer—a woman’s wiles have failed. 
A decent cat will never prowl the graves!— 
you don’t show off your treasure to all eyes! 
Don’t try to outtalk him and waste your breath— 
he’s your sole man, not one of three or four. 
It’s no disgrace to shun an elephant’s path!©— 
see if a jellyfish can leap the weir!!! 
Why don a croaker’s face and look so grim? 
Don’t yank at vines or you’ll shake up the woods. 
Don’t swim against a hawksbill or you'll lose!— 
how could a woman race and beat a man? 
Soon mend your petulant ways, learn gentle arts— 
two lovebirds will build their own nest and home.
Softness becomes a woman—it’s her strength, 
or else she’ll meet with sorrow and weep tears.” 
She heeded ’s advice—when she came home, 
she bowed and begged forgiveness from her rat. 
Back in his study,  took pen and ink 
and wrote the story down lest he forget. 
Such constancy as proven by a mouse 
deserves no little praise, and so it is! 
If beasts keep faith, remaining staunch and true,          
then why should men fall short and break their vows? 
A fickle heart betrays, plays fast and loose:  
men may be unaware, but Heaven knows. 
Traitors with brazen faces, when compared, 
prove not the equals of mere beasts or Bids 
The he-rat won no prize as he played false 
and coaxed the mouse to leave the path of right.  
The constant mouse lived up to her ideal 
although he proved himself a faithless rat. 
He found a widow doing what she must 
and tried to swerve her from the virtuous course. 
When raucous tiffs and fights broke out at home,  
he blamed them on a woman’s jealous streak. 
Praiseworthy was the mouse’s steadfast troth: 
temptation could not sway her true-red heart. 
Though rocks may fall and mountains may wear down, 
nothing can shift and change a stalwart faith.
