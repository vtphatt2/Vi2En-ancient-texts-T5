The marvelous neuter at Blue Creek
The world has always known this one word: love. 
Who, here below, can slip the Maker’s snare? 
Now ponder on the ways and works of fate: 
our Southern realm’s not far from fairyland. 
Think of those wondrous meetings in the past:  
first, Liu and Yiian; then later, P’ei and Chang.’ 
And lo, somebody climbed the Tower of Yang: 
his dreams of nuptial play were but a myth.”
West of the city lay Blue Creek, a scene 
of grass and flowers—what a charming sphere!  
A riot of spring peach blossoms and of autumn mums; 
pomegranates spat summer’s fire, plums hailed winter’s breath. 
Green rows of willows and green groves of pines; 
grass spread to herdmen’s paths, moss hid woodcutters’ tracks. 
It was a lonesome site of hills and streams—  
wind fluttered thin bamboos, rain fondled flowers. 
Under the Lé, when peace and concord reigned
there lived a peerless youth called Tran Tu Uyen.   
His parents’ virtues blessed him with good luck: 
why, who could rival him in looks or gifts? 
A boon from Heaven was his ready wit: 
still young, he reveled in a student’s joys. 
He strolled about and saw a lovely scene: 
a blend of wilderness and city life. 
Atop a knoll, he built his study-hut: 
old rush for walls and sparse bamboo for blinds. 
Butterflies’ dances and birds’ songs galore; 
a lamp and books, the wind and moon all round. 
Where else to find such lavish wealth for all? 
Hoards of mum gold and piles of lotus coins! 
Compare this with all other spots on earth: 
half wonderland and half a hermit’s home. 
Four gems enhanced his zest: he roved the sea’ 
of ancient saints and roamed the Muses’ grove.
The shuttle swung—the days and months whirled round: 
as plane trees dropped their leaves, the peaches blossomed forth. 
Behind the mulberry trees the sun sank fast:® 
his mother, then his father passed away. 
Alas for him who bore this flux and change, 
gazing on far white clouds, on yon blue hills. 
Under the twofold loss his shoulders sagged— 
Yen’s gourd was clean and empty: nothing left.? 
As summers went and autumns came by turns, 
sun pierced the shade, frost gathered round the porch. 
The skies froze at the wester’s breath: plums pined 
before the wind, the willows blanched with dew. 
The roof half bristled with uneven jags: 
thatch wattles stained by wind and rain-smeared limewashed walls. 
The scene was other than of old: parched mums 
along the hedge, foul lilies in the pond. 
As he met woes along his road, he grinned 
and hailed life’s boons or setbacks with good cheer. 
You win or lose as Heaven wills—he plumbed 
the sea of learning, and his sorrow ebbed. 
Plain rice for hunger, water for his thirst— 
can sparrows know what dreams an eagle dreams? 
His vow of yore weighed heavy on his mind: 
he’d at all costs acquit his manly debt. 
With brush and inkstone he spent happy hours: 
he praised West Lake, he sang of Fairy Hall."° 
The capital echoed with the poet’s name: 
he ranked with Li and Tu, matched Sun and Ts’ao.!! 
The bag of poems, slung across his back, 
could hold all streams or hills, all clouds or winds! 
Words decked with pearls! Thoughts blazoned on brocade! 
Gold tinkling on the ground! Crane flashing past the boat!2 
He only loved those women met in books— 
for years he had not sown the seed of jade."* 
A hovering skiff upon the stream of love— 
watching the moon, he’d clasp his lute and wait. 
Jade Lake observed a rite—the Buddha’s realm 
was all astir: now glowed the feast of spring. 
of wheels and horses raising clouds of dust. 
It swarmed with beaux and belles—a motley throng 
Enjoying spring, Ta Uyén went for a walk, 
his bag half filled with verse, his gourd with wine. 
While he, entranced, admired the Buddha’s world, 
the sun descended toward the western heights. 
The feast was over—one and all went home. 
Pear blossoms fell, swayed by the evening breeze. 
Beside the bridge, those groups of three or five 
might hide some nymph—what earthly eyes could tell? 
As he was lingering in the shadow of a tree, 
crimson leaf came flying with the breeze. 
He slowly read—the sense became quite clear: 
some lines of verse, a quatrain penned by hand. 
Perusing, he stayed dumbstruck for a while: 
“Who sent this flirting note to tease a man?” 
He was about to answer with some words 
when on the wind came wafting clouds of scent.
He saw a damsel there outside the gate 
with her cortege of waiting maids in tow. 
The lady was a marvel in his eyes: 
flower unblown, a moon just waxing full. 
Jade bracelets and gold hairpins shone on her— 
rainbow gown, a skirt of yellow silk. 
The gleam of jasper, and an orchid’s grace—charms fit 
to drown a fish aswim, to wing a bird in flight. 
She looked much fresher yet as she drew near, 
strewing faint hints of fragrance in her wake. 
Her eyes shot glints at him, suggesting spring— 
one glance, one whiff, and he fell deep in love! 
A youth as ardent as the student Chang,!® 
he’d met a charmer—what was he to do? 
She cast a glance, a tempting wave—it would have rocked 
heart of iron, let alone a man’s. 
If Heaven had not meant Tw Thi?c for love,!? 
could he have strayed and reached those fairy hills? 
The stranger his own heart already knew— 
he walked up to the swing and courted her: 
“Carried away by mirth, I’m making bold— 
forgive this shameful conduct toward a flower!” 
“This is the Buddha’s festival,” she said. 
“In his domain, forgiveness is the rule! 
The wind blows all away, both right and wrong— 
against you, sir, no blunder will be held.” 
The siren’s voice was music to his ears— 
near beauty’s ocean, waves of lust may surge. 
“T am a man with stillborn gifts,” he said. 
“May Charity shed her light on my true love! 
How can the Buddha’s garden lack for space? 
Open a little path and save me, please!” 
She answered, “Here the Golden Cord holds sway'®@— 
how dare you dally, uttering vulgar words? 
Dhyana’s a haven making room for all!?— 
its boat will ferry here benighted souls. 
But what a shame that near the Bodhi tree”° 
bee or butterfly comes hovering thus!" 
The Udumbara’s hung with golden bells
how dare a goldfinch perch thereon and chirp?” 
He listened, hushed, and heard the beauty out— 
his love, around her, wrapped a shield of scent. 
“Still lost on passion’s sea,” he said, “I shall 
redeem past deeds as I amend this life. 
What fate intends for us will be fulfilled
may Buddha tie us with the crimson thread.” 
Let his High Priest now wield the magic wand 
and raze the tower of sorrow to the ground. 
The pestle awaits the nymph of the Blue Bridge
what’s for the gods may land in human hands! 
Water and floating fern may someday meet?
across the river let’s now throw a bridge.”
As he kept dropping hints and wooing her, 
the nymph turned on her heel and mutely left. 
He followed her as far as Quang-Van Hall?°>— 
above the dancing branches rose the moon. 
Discreetly choosing words, the youth inquired: 
“Some purple mansion may be your abode. 
Or is your home some stream, if not some cloud? 
The winds of spring have blown you here, perchance? 
Show me the way to go there, if you please! 
Who’d reach Mount Jade and then return with naught?
I am so grateful for your kind concern, 
but who can tell what’s real from what’s unreal?” 
That said, she vanished, lost amid the pines— 
her fragrance lingered, but the bird had fled. 
Wind-borne, the phoenix soared to reach the skies— 
the nymph went home, but love she left on earth. 
He scanned the pageantry of rolling clouds, 
spellbound, bewitched, though far from fairyland.  
Still dazed, he groped by moonlight his way home. 
The pine-oil lamp burned low—yet he sought sleep. 
Her haunting image how could he forget? 
She lingered there, possessing all his dreams. 
The lovelorn butterfly longed for his flower. 
He yearned and pined—imagine, then, his gloom! 
At times, he strummed the zither, but the tune 
conjured up streams and hills, evoking her. 
His hand would play “A phoenix woos his mate”— 
did she, Wen-chiin, feel what Hsiang-ju now felt?2® 
At times, he tried to drink peach-blossom wine— 
before he’d drained the cup, it filled with tears. 
And with each sip, the fumes bedimmed his mind, 
stirring remembrance and arousing love. 
At times, he sat awake as cuckoo-birds 
wailed at the moon and bells tolled death of day. 
They jarred his nerves and wrenched his very guts. 
Could love burn out? Could lovelorn tears be stanched? 
At times, he languished in the moonglow, as 
geese sailed the night and orioles hymned the dawn.  
He watched the play of nature’s scenes and sounds— 
to whom could he confide his secret thoughts? 
Spring joy throughout the sky belonged to all— 
spring sorrow weighed upon one man alone. 
Love moved the student’s hand to pen a note— 
he sent his love sealed with the written plea: 
“OQ Moon, you favor love. Pray, part the clouds— 
for lovers cast a bridge amid the stars! 
I ask to see that blossom face to face— 
how can you fence a garden now, in spring?” 
Among his schoolmates, one who was named Ha 
noticed his plight and gently queried him: 
“Why wear that glum expression on your face? 
A lovelorn soul, you spurn your daily meals; 
your study you’ve deserted for some time; 
you seem to have turned rather thin and wan. 
Tell what it’s all about to your old friend: 
perhaps I could assuage what’s ailing you.” 
How shrewd a guess! It did strike home: 
what’s hidden in the heart can’t fool the eye. 
Though love is no one’s sole preserve, 
only the lover knows how longing hurts. 
For ages out of mind both fools and saints 
have all enmeshed themselves in toils of love. 
But to speak out? How awkward it would sound! 
And to keep still would ache and rankle so. 
He could not lie about what caused his pain— 
he took Ha’s hand and told him everything: 
“The more I talk, the more I yearn for her! 
A woman’s looks can shake a heart of steel. 
The girl’s perfume excites me yet—          
my heartstrings get all tangled up in love. 
My gloom is vast, one hour seems like one year: 
how could I then endure, not waste away? 
But all men always have experienced this: 
they all have borne a common load of grief. 
Strange that her kind should breathe forth heaven’s scent! 
Just try forgetting them—you never could!” 
Ha heard his friend’s account from first to last 
and thought the story passing strange, indeed: 
“Tf not a goddess, she must be a nymph, 
still bound to earth by some predestined love. 
The crimson leaf becomes the crimson thread*°— 
water and floating fern may sometimes meet. 
A fairy tale did happen at Jade Lake. 
Our emperor Lé once visited that shrine.*! 
In its bell tower he met a girl who sang 
an eerie song and could revise his verse. 
He praised her silken words, brocaded thoughts. 
He loved her looks and prized a poet’s gifts— 
he hoped to bring her home and marry her, 
but in a flash she vanished from his ken. 
It all took place just fifteen years ago: 
a trace is left—the temple named Nymph Watch.” 
Ta Uyén could not believe that fairy tale— 
he showed the leaf, and it amazed his friend. 
On this strange leaf Ha saw a fairy’s hand 
that wrote what should bewitch a mortal’s heart. 
“Swallow and swan are worlds apart,” said Uyén. 
“How could I cross all streams and get to her? 
Despite the walls dividing east from west, 
though she be far, one day Ill find her near. 
Love’s palace may be many miles away— 
if fate so wills, the wind shall blow me there.” 
“But in affairs of fated troth,” said Ha, 
“love foreordained may wait till after death.  
A futile chase, your looking for the nymph. 
Which hill or stream to search in quest of her? 
Which bird or fish will bear your word of love? 
Go pluck the moon, a needle from the sea! 
Do you know where your nymph makes her abode?  
Why idly pine away and sorely grieve? 
Don’t ask for trouble falling so in love— 
all nuptial matters trust to Lady Moon!? 
As one spring goes, another spring will come— 
wait till next year and pick your marriage peach!”  
In bed Ta Uyén looked back and gazed ahead, 
feeling a burden lifted from his soul. 
Relieved, he brightened up—he talked and laughed, 
since, with his change of heart, lust turned to love. 
He waited for the nymph, for news of her:  
short days of hope deferred, long sleepless nights. 
He yearned for one who stayed out of his reach— 
among his books, he dreamed of fairyland. 
He daily visited Jade Lake, the shrine— 
when you are sad, you sadden grass and trees.  
The selfsame sky, the selfsame streams and hills; 
blue clouds and emerald waters as of yore; 
peach blossoms blooming still on that same spot— 
but where was she, the girl of yesterday? 
The dismal breezes stirred a clump of reeds,  
and gloom descended further in his heart.
Consult an oracle! He seized the thought. 
At White Horse Shrine he had his fortune told. 
He prayed, then to the western porch retired. 
The candle flickered, incense sticks glowed red.  
The moon was shining through the plane-tree leaves— 
snug in his blanket, he dropped off to sleep. 
He saw a figure with high bonnet and loose gown— 
with iron rod in hand: an awesome sight. 
He heard an order thundered from the yard: 
“At daybreak go and wait by the Té-lich! 
Need lovebirds on their own make their love tryst? 
For you, East Bridge serves as the blackbirds’ bridge!” 
Blissful, the boy awakened from his dream— 
the stars had dimmed, the sky was tinged with dawn. 
Love prodded him to sally forth in quest. 
He hurried there: he could not glimpse a soul. 
Clear water, lush green grass—a bridge of stone: 
where was the nymph with whom he had a tryst? 
He watched and waited for a livelong hour— 
while standing vigil, he felt like an oaf. 
Tired and bored, he meekly crawled back home, 
looking half sane, half mad—a butt for jokes! 
Now he met a stranger in the street 
who had in hand the picture of a girl. 
At once he begged to take a look and see. 
It was the portrait of a lady fair— 
her face, so deftly limned in paint, seemed like 
the face he had admired at Quang-Van Hall. 
The more he gazed, the more he loved the art— 
could a Wang Wei have made this masterpiece??? 
He bought the picture, brought it home to hang 
right in his study: a charm against his gloom! 
He locked the door and day and night he lived 
with that depicted beauty as his mate. 
He brought her chopsticks, treated her to meals—        
he challenged her with verse, plied her with wine. 
He eyed the picture and imagined things:  
her portrait might well be real flesh and blood! 
A quiet day when autumn came around— 
frost heaped cold silver, sycamores dropped gold. 
A mood of longing autumn will induce— 
who’ll gaze down on the Hsiang and not shed tears  
He hugged the portrait and entreated her, 
telling what had befallen him, his folks: 
“Since I met you, my goddess, face to face, 
asleep or waking, I have dreamed of you. 
You’ve decked yourself with powder and with rouge,  
but let me pine and languish over you. 
You never leave your bower—could your smile 
be purchased for a thousand coins of gold? 
For me unlock that palace in the moon: 
part clouds and let me peek at Ch’ang O’s face!?  
Upon her peach-red lips he glimpsed a smile— 
her face a flower that hailed the Lord of Spring.” 
Thus, passion is the norm for one and all— 
not even nymphs slip through the noose of love. 
One day, when school was over, he came home  
and found the board already spread with food. 
He tasted—heavenly flavors it disclosed, 
redolent of flowers and of scents unknown. 
Was there some magic kitchen hereabouts? 
He marveled at those dishes fit for gods.  
At dawn he left for school as was his wont, 
but he rushed back to spy the household out. 
Wonder of wonders! He beheld this scene: 
she in the picture could move to and from! 
Eyebrows like willow leaves, her face a rose:  
the goddess he had met was present now. 
As she was busy grooming, unawares 
he pushed the door ajar and tiptoed in. 
He greeted her—he felt the sheerest bliss, 
she kept a coy reserve: both brimmed with love. 
“I’ve yearned for you all these past months,” he said. 
“Please tell me, now I have you, who you are.” 
She said, “My lot’s the frailty of a reed— 
a woman’s tied by fate’s red silken thread. 
I used to dwell amid the azure spheres— 
my title is Tién-Xu, my name Giang Kiéu. 
Over three lifetimes fate has bound us two!— 
to you this humble maiden’s troth stands pledged. 
For you I was predestined long ago, 
and now the bond of wedlock draws us close. 
The Wise Old Prince be thanked for what he’s wrought: 
from now this rose shall know the Lord of Spring.” 
“Over too many days,” the student said, 
“T swallowed grief, my pillow was despair. 
If Heaven will join us two with marriage ties, 
then why subject my heart to that ordeal?”
She answered, “Yes, I’ll give to you my hand. 
Heaven’s my witness—I do love you true. 
But I care not to vie with Ts’ui Ying-ying, 
allowing lust to burn and love to cool. 
She failed to guard her virtue when with Chang— 
their love soon lost its glow and broke to bits. 
The world still scorns their Western Chamber fling— 
a mirror of misconduct for us all. 
When blows the easter, naturally a flower 
may yield her fragrance at the bluebird’s call.“ 
After the storm of loveless lust has passed, 
she, faded, will be spurned by other birds.
A woman’s honor’s fragile—if she errs, 
a blatant disrepute will follow her.” 
That said, she pulled a hairpin from her hair 
and made a magic sign—two maids appeared. 
Abustle, they prepared a sumptuous feast: 
censers all wreathed in smoke, wine cups infused with scent. 
To his own ardor liquor lent more fire— 
the boy played drunk, attempting to make free. 
“We two were foreordained to wed,” she said. 
“If not, could I have come down here on earth? 
But I have some close friends I left behind— 
I have not paid them back for their kind deeds. 
Let me first treat my sisters from Pearl Hall— 
for our own love there’s time enough ahead!” 
He heard such prudent words as pleased his ears; 
he would not press his lust against her wish.
All decked with ornaments, the courtyard rang 
with glee among the flowers, beneath the moon. 
As iridescent clouds begirt the house, 
the grass-thatched hut changed to a splendid hall. 
An aura lit this corner of the skies— 
a shower of caps and gowns, of skirts and shoes. 
Fay spirits hobnobbed with ethereal nymphs— 
each peerless maiden boasted her own charm. 
With gay abandon they all talked and laughed— 
they hailed their friend and toasted her new groom. 
As crimson played with gold, they swayed and swirled— 
their dance gowns winked and shimmered in the night.
They drank much wine, and when the revels peaked, 
the fuddled guests excused themselves and left. 
They rode in coaches headed for the clouds— 
the bride-bed welcomed now the newlyweds. 
The bridal garlands lay discarded there—         
the quilt was spread, the curtain was let down. 
Inside their niche they traded toasts of troth— 
as blazed the nuptial torch, they dropped the shade. 
The fishing boat sailed toward Peach Blossom Cave—  
clouds rolled, rains poured upon the a of love. 
How much pure gold could buy one hour of spring? 
Heaven on earth, when Man and Woman meet! 
For Lady Moon, once in a thousand years, 
spins perfect threads and joins her chosen few!  
It was a crimson tie of love and trust 
to bind the lovers henceforth, evermore. 
Since on the lute the strings had touched the frets, 
after those days of longing, they knew bliss. 
Cool breeze, bright moon—at all such balmy times,  
they sipped celestial nectar, played duets. 
Amid a spray of frost, a rain of flowers, 
they swapped some verse or by the screen played chess. 
A beautiful maiden and a handsome boy 
enjoyed together all the world’s delights.  
At one, a lover and his lady fair 
shared nature’s treasures—heaven on this earth. 
A happy home where gathered all his friends— 
as housewife and as hostess she excelled.
Year followed year: three had by now gone past—  
almonds and pomegranates had bloomed and bloomed. 
The union they had thought so perfect once 
was blighted by the fate that had joined them. 
After the earthly student wed the nymph, 
he would indulge in wine more than before.  
He daily staged a drunken bout or two— 
to stop him then, she chidingly would say: 
“By your kind leave I shall impart my thoughts.  
How can you act this way and spoil your life? 
But they abound, examples from the past, 
written in stone, not soon to wear away. 
Who roamed the hills with hoe to dig his grave? 
Who dived into a river for the moon? 
If you don’t know the error of your ways, 
let both hold up a mirror for your sake.” 
In vain, alas, did she admonish him— 
her words flowed off like water off a rock. 
All through the livelong day and night he drank, 
consorting with Liu Ling or with Li Po.>! 
While liquor, fateful demon, haunted him, 
his lute fell hushed, his incense burned no more. 
As spirits kept his soul and wits bemused, 
she tried all different ways to plead with him. 
It grated on his ears and strained his nerves— 
while drunk, he brutally struck and battered her. 
He tore in two what had united them— 
she’d fain have drifted, fernlike, down the stream. 
The constant nymph poured tears of heaven’s grief, 
as she deplored the human’s fickle love. 
“My words exceeded what I meant,” she said. 
“please calm your wrath and deign to pardon me.” 
He kept carousing, happy in his cups— 
his mind, bedeviled, reeled, lost to the world. 
Nothing she kept repeating moved him now— 
on her he heaped a drunkard’s foul abuse. 
“About our love and marriage,” said the nymph, 
“ah woe, spilt water can’t refill the bowl. 
Pity the Herdboy and his Weaver Maid— 
in fall, how often can they cross the bridge? 
Why care for this base blossom any more? 
Why bother any more with love gone stale?
Since you intend to split two lovebirds up 
and cast me from your side, I must obey. 
It’s over—let’s pretend we give it back, 
the crimson thread and all, to Lady Moon!”  
She bowed, then out she flew and disappeared, 
leaving him slumped in stupor at his desk. 
Sodden and drunken, he knew not a thing— 
as slowly he revived, he learned the truth. 
Where was she now? And how to win her back?  
He might see her in dreams, but nowhere else. 
The fairy hills were many leagues away— 
he could not send a word through those thick clouds. 
swirls of gold sand and silver dust far off— 
mists crawled on earth, hills soared at heaven’s foot. 
Deep streams and seas lay past his human ken— 
the way stretched forth like his own love for her. 
He sadly watched the landscape robbed of life—  
the breeze stirred leaves and frost weighed branches down. 
He sadly watched the sea cove—vast, immense, 
it harbored throngs of little boats downstream. 
He sadly watched where Hsing-yang Town began— 
wild geese, dew-drenched, winged southward like a flash.  
He sadly watched the River Tô flow on— 
birds cried in bushes, buffalo roamed bare fields. 
The bleak and desolate scenery touched this man 
with heartstrings tangled in a web of love. 
Was he Chang Shih reborn, who failed to reach  
those fairy hills to which his wife had flown? 
And did she share the destiny of Ch’ang, 
moon-bound and all alone on winter nights?
He mused upon his plight—the nymph had fled, 
while he was left to wait and yearn for her. 
As night and day wheeled round with moon and wind, 
disheartened, he kept brooding on the world. 
Why mock a human so, Old Lady Moon? 
You spun a flimsy thread and tied it loose. 
They lived apart—she stayed on fairy hills, 
unlike some stream that would flow back to earth. 
He watched the painting: it still looked like her, 
powdered and rouged—with her the soul had fled. 
He languished and despaired of everything— 
allowed himself no sleep, enjoyed no food. 
Thinner he grew: a mere cicada’s shell,’ 
a gibbon’s broken heart, a cuckoo’s lovelorn soul. 
To lull his grief, ten poems he composed: 
each word a tear, each line a string of pearls.
One day, Ha came to visit Tran, his friend. 
The boy’s distress moved him to give advice: 
“Who knows that she’s a nymph and not a fiend? 
Though luck bring weal or woe, please grieve no more. 
If she’s a nymph, she’s through with you as mate: 
the pearl will not come back to your Ho-p’u.? 
So make an effort, friend, and brighten up: 
discard your heartache, cast it all away! 
Should something happen that attracts the stare 
of vulgar eyes, would it befit you well?” 
Tran answered, “Once, I swore my solemn troth— 
as firm as rock, it must now be redeemed. 
I’d rather bear the world’s derisive taunts 
than play her false—my mate, my kindred soul. 
The thread that ties us two was no mistake— 
a silkworm never ceases spinning silk. 
Why trouble over what concerns you not? 
Wear out your tongue but you’ll not shake my heart!” 
Ha learned he’d spoken words to no avail— 
embarrassed, he excused himself and left. 
The visitor regained his study room— 
alone with his own shadow, Tran despaired. 
He set his mind on scouring fairy hills— 
he’d pledge his troth to her in afterlife. 
Her sash of silk hung ready at his side— 
he’d use it now to end both lust and love. 
A breeze that wafted fragrance stirred the blind— 
a garland scattered flowers on the sill. 
While, startled, he was wondering yet, he heard 
the pad of shoes and saw her reappear. 
They faced each other—he was stunned and dazed: 
awake, he thought he hovered in some dream. 
Propitious fate had brought her back in time— 
one minute more and he’d have killed himself. 
With goggle-eyed astonishment he stared; 
joy from his heart spoke words to welcome her. 
He said, “Since I first missed your lovely face, 
my soul’s dwelt on the moon and roamed the clouds. 
I was about to brave the streams and seas 
and cross the bridge between this life and death. 
I could not play you false, beloved wife— 
I call to witness Heaven and the earth. 
But why reopen bygone matters now? 
To you I hereby vow my love and troth.” 
“The lute has found the player’s hand,” she said. 
“You like its sound—dare I roll up its strings? 
You did love’s labor for my sake—dare I 
still keep love’s censer cold and light no fire?”
They swore their wedded love and troth anew— 
together, they retired to their own nest. 
In their spring garden, flower and bee had met—  
after long absence, love more fiercely blazed. 
For years they shared soft pillows, a warm bed— 
locked room and bolted door protected love. 
On its peach branch an oriole cried good news— 
from that fine tree a scion had sprung forth!  
The boy, named Tran, partook of fairyhood— 
for him a scholar’s glory lay in store. 
With fervor now, Uyén burned the midnight oil, 
all poised to leap the waves and ride the clouds.! 
He’d soar and roam officialdom’s high spheres—  
but calmly she explained a thing or two. 
“Look, and see through this world’s affairs,” said she. 
“How fame and gain hold many men in thrall! 
In autumn skies clouds gather and disperse; 
In springtime flowers bloom and shortly fade.  
Eighty or ninety years, that is life’s span: 
the colt flies past your window and won’t stop!” 
The world’s a sojourn for your bag of bones— 
inside the Maker’s furnace things are born to die. 
Who can escape from this terrestrial cage?  
How many are the earthlings greed has drowned! 
Wise thinkers and brave heroes of all times 
have ended there to rot with weeds and shrubs. 
As days roll on and months must wane and pass, 
a woman’s cheeks soon pale, her hair soon grays.  
The wilds hold ancient ruins—what stands there? 
The famed Bronze Sparrow Tower? Yiieh-yang Hall?™ 
The play of flux and change still runs on stage, 
but iron hills have crumbled down to dust. 
You’d better spend your days on holy heights:
there bliss reigns everywhere, all year is spring. 
At will you'll rove four oceans and five lakes 
or roam across three islands and ten reefs. 
You’ll dwell in golden domes and ruby halls— 
with gourd of nectar, you’ll haunt mists and streams. 
Hamlets all snug in snow, towns decked with flowers— 
pines dance to castanets, brooks sing to lutes. 
One day of leisure in our wonderland 
is worth ten thousand years right here on earth. 
Think and conclude: Which is the happier bird, 
a cooped-up cock or free crane in the wilds?” 
He felt divided—lured by fairyland, 
he was not cured of passion for this world. 
He said, “A sword and books have fallen to my lot. 
If I play hermit, who'll play Yi or Chou?” 
“A man who merits such a name,” she said, 
“keeps his own soul unsoiled by gain or loss. 
Covet and get all wealth on earth—a bird 
that flies and flies can’t break through heaven’s bounds! 
Why make my fellow fairies laugh? Enjoy 
a crane’s or gibbon’s life where rainbows gleam. 
If to this hurly-burly world you cling, 
who will inhabit those three dozen caves?” 
He listened, learned the cause of past mistakes— 
awaked from sleep, he cleansed off earthly dust. 
He queried her: “Like Huang-ti and An Ch’i, 
how can a man achieve immortal life?” 
“Our magic works such wonders,” she replied. 
“Both Ch’iao and Sung became immortals thus. 
And you belong to scholardom’s high spheres— 
you’re listed there, among the chosen few. 
Study till you have learned the Way of Truth, 
till you have grasped essential mysteries!
She handed him a jujube and an amulet, 
a crucible for pills of lasting life.  
With pure delight the two discussed the Way— 
lotus wine soothed their tongues and orchid tea their hearts. 
Wind in the willows, moon on sycamores: 
time flew and human bones seemed buoyed by wings. 
As he was smelting ore for gold or silver,  
he dreamed of Hsi Wang Mu, and of the Wise Old Prince. 
Now, out of nowhere, rainbow clouds appeared— 
two cranes alit to pick the couple up. 
They mounted, holding hands and full of glee— 
he urged their son to keep his once-sworn vow:  
“For you a laureate’s glorious hour will sound. 
Let clouds and dragon meet! You’ll join us then.”” 
That said, they started on the path of clouds— 
the cranes winged west and vanished out of view. 
They reached P’eng-lai, a world unto itself,”  
a god-wrought site: flowers for curtains, rocks for beds.
