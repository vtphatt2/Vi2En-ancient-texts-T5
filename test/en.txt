The quarrel of the six beasts
Heaven creates all things; 
earth nurtures every kind. 
What breed or species wants for skills? 
How can a man dispense with beasts? 
The Dragon mends the sky and bathes the sun;! 
The Unicorn assists all gods and saints;” 
the Tortoise sees the future, good or ill; 
the Phoenix can tell weal from woe and rise from fall. 
Within the orb of three thousandfold worlds, 
they’re called the Four Most Holy Animals. 
And then there are six sacrificial beasts 
that Heaven sent to succor men below. 
All aches and sores, the Buffalo laments: 
“T bear the brunt of many tasks alone. 
The Cock no sooner crows night’s end 
than summoning the herdboy up, 
the Master tells him, ‘Drive the Buffalo 
to pasture now and let him graze a bit.’ 
But all too soon the east glows red— 
it’s time to toil, to labor hard. 
In front two ropes coil round my neck; 
behind I have to pull a plow. 
A bridle ties my mouth, a rope my nose. 
Flies swarm my body, leeches prick my legs. 
When, tired to death, I pant and puff, 
the man will curse me right and left. 
When at high noon he lets me off,   
worn out and hungry, I can hardly budge. 
While others rest, may I just idle too? 
When I’m exhausted, who will take my place? 
I plow them all, both deep and shallow fields; 
I till the beds for pulse and sesame. 
At work I don’t have time to breathe; 
at meals I don’t have time to chew. 
Do I complain of rain or wind? 
Do I rebel at dew or frost?
I, Buffalo, give them their grains, their silks— 
without me, Buffalo, no fruits, no nuts! 
It’s I who'll haul the stalks of rice they’ve cut; 
it’s I who'll thrash the sheaves they’re piling up. 
From the first moon until the last, 
from spring to winter, all year round, 
as soon as farming work is done, 
I cart all things, enjoying not one break. 
Branches for hedges, wood for fuel, 
twigs, thatch, bamboo, manure— 
take anything that must be moved: 
it falls on me to carry all. 
Am I to balk at hills and heights? 
Am I to flinch from brooks and streams? 
I hunch my back and drag my load 
while scathing words are hurled at me. 
Dry hay and weeds, that’s all I eat; 
can I reject their nasty stall? 
I, Buffalo, have set up this or that, 
established bins or garners, high and low. 
Were I to get my full deserts, 
I should be clad in silk, no less. 
I’d settle, though, for hemp or cotton pants, 
or even for a cloth around the loins. 
I should be given rice and fish to eat—      
or, short of that, thin gruel mixed with greens. 
When someday I grow old and fail in strength, 
I should be nursed as payment for my pains, 
Instead of offering me no sacrifice, 
they should feed me in death just as in life. 
Men close their hearts to me while I’m alive— 
they will mistreat my spirit when I’m dead. 
They’ll hand each other baskets and sharp knives; 
they’ll fetch grass kindling and dry wood for fire. 
They'll say, ‘The Buffalo was Buddha once. 
Let’s set the brute aflame and speed his soul 
to Paradise!’ About my poor remains, 
they all will huddle and decide. 
One man suggests, ‘I’ll take the head!’ 
Another cries, “The dewlap!” They’ll fight to get 
the bowels and bladder—pillows for their heads. 
They'll fashion combs and shuttles with the horns 
or turn them into earrings and fan ribs, 
measuring bowls and cups for wine, 
fine bugles you can blow quite loud 
or chessmen you bang hard upon the board, 
a clapper or a box, 
handles of fans and knives. 
My legs they’ll share among themselves 
to make some salads with raw meat. 
All said and done, we buffalo are beasts 
condemned by fate without appeal. 
When dead, I’ll be brushed off like so much dust. 
While still alive, I’ll tell the Master this. 
Remember? At blood-smearing rites for bells 
the king of Ch’i reprieved an innocent. 
When old and feeble, I shall bless T’ien-tzu 
who bade his children not to sell their beasts. 
Have you forgotten it, my lord,      
this timeless precept from the past? 
‘By your own virtue act upon the world!’ 
Instead, you’ve rendered evil for good deeds! 
Must I keep spinning matters out? 
My lord, let me butt in and say a word. 
No looks, no skills—why take such pains 
to rear the Dog and all his breed? 
They stuff themselves quite nice and plump 
only to play and wreck your home, your grounds. 
They hang around for their three meals 
and sidle off when work’s at hand. 
Before it’s cold, they show how cold they feel, 
curl up and tuck their tails between their legs, 
or paw the straw and ashes on the hearth, 
knock topsy-turvy all three kitchen gods.? 
Before it’s hot, they sprawl around and gasp 
while lolling out their span-long tongues. 
When you don’t watch but look the other way, 
they filch your food—that’s one thing they do best. 
If only they knew how to till the land, 
ah, they would claim all credit in the world! 
They gorge on well-cooked rice and gruel 
while I must chew tough hay and straw. 
And when they die, you’ll bury them 
with votive gifts, in solemn rites. 
The lord is inhumane—he favors curs 
while he mistreats one who deserves much more!” 
The Dog has heard those words—his bosom smarts. 
Quick he runs out and yelps a shrill retort: 
“Heaven endows each kind with its own skills— 
big beasts get harder tasks, small beasts light chores. 
Because you boast huge shoulders and huge thighs, 
you are assigned to plow-and-harrow work. 
I, Dog, though weak of limb from birth,’     
still do my best to guard the house. 
So smart, you blow on hair and look for scars; 
meddling, you part the leaves and grope for worms.' 
We share the same condition, you and I— 
both serve the Master with a single heart. 
Some act one part, some play another role; 
some tend the outside world, some watch home grounds. 
My eyes are kept wide open through the night— 
burglars, fear-stricken, all stay out of sight. 
My eardrums, all day long, are on alert— 
knaves panic when they catch a glimpse of me. 
When men’s ancestral spirits must be fed, 
I go out hunting squirrels, chasing foxes. 
Do I mind wriggling through sharp thorns? 
Do I complain when muzzling into holes? 
How come you feel no sorrow for my plight? 
Instead, you draw such envious parallels! 
I swallow crumbs of rice and dregs of soup, 
when it’s not rotten taro, wormy yam. 
At mealtime I don’t care how much I get— 
if there’s an empty bowl, that has to do! 
You say you’re fed coarse straw and grass— 
but then you have a boy to wait on you. 
He costs not only clothes and food, 
but wages, too, and bonus gifts. 
He’s paid twice yearly at the least— 
a herdboy’s pay is worth one buffalo. 
You claim your labor makes the Master rich: 
just earn your keep and you'll have done enough! 
To me the Master trusts his family wealth, 
and I cost him no penny for a boy. 
And yet, without my watchful eyes and ears, 
that wealth would vanish into burglars’ hands. 
You, Buffalo, can talk but cannot think      
and see how much I, Dog, perform. 
The goods and chattels I protect on earth— 
in death I’ll guard that bridge to the Dark World.” 
I'll help the virtuous ones escape from hell— 
the mean and wicked I shall not let pass! 
Mindful of past and future services, 
the lord will bury me with cash and rice.
If he grants me great favors and large boons, 
how shall I fail to welcome him down there? 
I see you don’t yet know the roots of things— 
I’m telling you lest you think me a fool!” 
As Buffalo and Dog lodge their complaint, 
the Master’s at a loss whose side to take:
“Enough comparison twixt Me and Thee! 
I bid you two make peace—it’s past all price.” 
Once reconciled, together, those two beasts 
bow low before their lord and speak these words: 
“If you’re to judge by what we both perform, 
we are beset with worries day and night. 
Excuse us—is he such a prize, the Horse, 
that you take pains to house him in such style? 
For nourishment you feed him green bean soup; 
you lodge him in a stable roofed with tile. 
Each day he gets spruced up, then takes a stroll; 
each day you pare his hoofs, you clip his mane. 
You’ve gone to such expenses for his sake— 
just reckon up the hundreds you’ve disbursed. 
You’ve bought a saddle, bells, caparison, 
You've bought stirrups, a bit, and reins; 
fringes of gilt that hang from head to tail; 
under the belly, silver-coated bands and straps.      
Though they put on such pompous airs, 
home matters leave them in a daze. 
At the plow or harrow they will horse around, 
and on a hunt they can trot out no skill. 
They’re not aware who raises them, 
can’t find their way and go back home.' 
They do not qualify as fools, 
nor should their wisdom be proclaimed. 
They scurry round like snails with borrowed souls!— 
why ask for trouble rearing them?” 
Those spiteful words arouse the Horse’s bile— 
he rushes out and whinnies his rebuke: 
“Hey, let me tell you blokes some facts! 
Now, who can boast a face as long as mine? 
We all are beasts, but there are beasts and beasts: 
of all known animals who rivals me? 
I’ve roamed the empire’s length and breadth; 
I’ve raced to many battles north and south. 
My knees have labored for the public good; 
my back has buckled under kings and lords. 
Each day I wait upon the dragon throne; 
each day I must escort the phoenix coach.!© 
Kao-tsu waged war on horseback for five years 
until he won the empire for the Liu. 
Kuan Yii once fought through all six border gates 
with his Green Dragon sword, on his Red Hare.!
I’ve rescued strongholds and defended towns; 
I’ve braved keen arrows and defied sharp shots. 
Over a thousand miles, through hills and heights, 
I’ve galloped at a stretch from post to post. 
You little guys can eat and sleep your fill 
because I’ve kept relentless watch. 
With zeal I guard the country’s peace— 
glad farmers everywhere can farm.         
You dogs just snuggle up in kitchen nooks; 
you buffalo shine only in the fields. 
Stop spouting gibberish; hold back your urge 
to plunge headfirst and criticize. 
Without my presence, who protects the realm? 
If bandits come, will they leave you alone? 
You know a thing or two, but not enough— 
don’t glory in your little skills and knacks.” 
The Horse harangues at length and makes his point— 
to heal the breach, the Master says some words: 
“You’re big and small, but talents each can claim, 
so cease to fight among yourselves.”
And so all three, Horse, Buffalo, and Dog, 
pay homage to their lord and make to leave. 
But as he bears the Goat no love, the Horse 
stays on a while and enters his own suit: 
“The Goat is just a beast like me— 
we both are kept and fed by you. 
But you allow him time to frisk and play 
while you ride me and run me off my legs. 
Yet what’s a goat? A head without a tail! 
A bloated body on a stunted trunk! 
He waddles like a chap whose testes hurt; 
he skips and scampers like a bandit’s kid. 
He looks so awkward when he tries to trot 
and cuts a sorry figure at the plow. 
When someone hovers by his side, 
he gapes his mouth and cries, ‘Baa-baa!’” 
The Goat has heard the Horse disparage him— 
his beard perked up, he prances out and says: 
“Let us compare your bulk and mine— 
which one is bigger, Horse or Goat? 
You’ve visited all towns and capitals—       
why waste your notice on a country clod? 
A stronger beast, you’ve served the Master’s realm, 
yet don’t you act so high and mighty, Horse! 
The Master will reward those with rare skills, 
but let the rest work too and earn their keep. 
I, Goat, don’t dare to touch his rice and yam; 
I never tamper with his greens and beans. 
Let me advise you—cease your bumptious talk 
and take less pride in your much-vaunted strength. 
Who doesn’t know that horses have long tails? 
Long tails can flap at gadflies and mosquitoes. 
But though my tail is short and clipped, 
no, thanks—I shan’t add yours to mine! 
You brag you can breeze through a thousand miles— 
I jump and clear three knolls: that’s work enough. 
I, Goat, cut capers as I wish— 
you, Horse, go through your paces and cavort. 
For plow and harrow some are born; 
others exist to trot and run. 
We goats by nature go with sacraments— 
yes, we come in when scholars hold their rites, 
when men must plead with saints or gods, 
ask them for peace and happiness. 
At such grave times we’re granted precedence— 
men offer goats before they kneel and pray. 
You look impressive both in bulk and height, 
but who considers horsemeat fit for gods? 
If humans build a shrine, a market shed, 
they immolate a goat, then break the ground. 
On days when generals go off to war, 
they slaughter one of us, then sally forth. 
About the new-moon feast Confucius said: 
‘Begrudge a goat, Tzu-kung, and lose a rite?’ 
You speak at random and don’t think—        
in merit are we goats so wanting, Horse? 
Talk straight and to the point— 
don’t slander and malign. 
Though short of tail and small of head, 
I’m titled Registrar with a Long Beard!? 
What beast outranks your humble Goat? 
Your lowly Goat ranks high in all the world! 
Since you have moved among the great, 
what title have they granted you? 
O Master, judge the Horse and me, the Goat! 
Please weigh our work—whose service tips the scale?” 
The Horse has listened, learned some truths— 
who'd think the little goat a big, big shot? 
The Goat replies and shows a serpent’s guile; 
the Horse protests and struts a dragon’s strength. 
The Master thus decrees: “You two are peers— 
let each mind his own business and concern.” 
Once Horse and Goat have come to terms, 
the Goat sets on the Rooster thus: 
“We goats and horses do the realm much good— 
you raise those chickens and receive no thanks. 
Sow beds with mustard or coriander seeds— 
clucking, they will all scratch and pull up roots. 
Lay down some rows of manioc or peas— 
they all will trample leaves and blooms to shreds. 
Just when you thatch your roof, up there they’ll hop 
to peck at straws and strew them to the winds. 
Feed them—they’ll wipe their beaks and turn their backs;! 
before night falls, they’re ready for their roost.” 
They never leave a heap of trash alone; 
they never give the greens a chance to root. 
They pester you, bedevil you all day— 
what does it profit you to raise their tribe?” 
The Rooster’s lungs and liver burn with rage— 
wings flapping, head a-cocking, he jumps out: 
“Come, now! Five virtues roosters all possess— 
kind, brave, and loyal, skilled at war and peace. 
A mandarin’s cap adorns our brow; 
our claws display two lethal spears. 
Time and again, I’ve served on battlefields 
and there performed resounding feats of arms. 
As drums beat fast the third watch in Lung-hsi, 
I crowed three crows before day broke. 
The first one said, ‘O sun, arise betimes!’ 
The second said, ‘Long live and thrive our king!’ 
The third one said, ‘Let joy prevail on earth!’ 
Somebody feigned my voice and saved Meng Ch’ang;” 
my call aroused two gallant men of Tsin.” 
Whoever wants to change his evil ways 
wakes up at cockcrow, bent on doing good.” 
The rising destiny of Chou was augured by a rooster’s leg. 
I sing and soothe all those with sleepless nights; 
I crow and cheer all those who wait for dawn. 
Now that you ponder such home truths, 
do you perceive the sense of things? 
You angered me as you kept talking grub 
or trying to pick holes and point at flaws. 
We roosters know the rites as well as goats— 
you’re Registrar, I’m Herald of the Morn! 
Just those few facts prove I’m your match— 
I’ve left unmentioned all a healing arts. 
I wonder who’s the slugabed! 
I wonder who’s the villain of the piece! 
Since none is hired to wach me come and go, 
at times I scratch and claw where I should not. 
There’s always someone looking after goats,
yet ten times more destruction you have wrought. 
Does chicken feed cost overmuch each day? 
You make such picayune comparisons 
I have to teach you, Goat, a thing or two 
or you’d think me a feckless chap on earth. 
Have you forgotten? Roosters chime the dawn 
to make all husbands cherish virtuous wives,” 
to bid all Shun’s disciples do good works.” 
I'll yield to you in this, your toady’s beard, 
which serves no purpose, come to think of it. 
Comparing us, why should I envy you? 
To my sound reasons lend an ear.” 
After he’s heard the Rooster’s case, 
the Goat begins to see both sides: 
“Enough! One word is plenty to the wise— 
I'll gladly sign a compact and make peace!” 
The Rooster’s wrath still smolders in his breast— 
he lets the Master know as he speaks out: 
“IT, Rooster, serve you faithfully and well— 
I’m always last to bed and first to rise. 
You once took care of me, a chick— 
grown up, I shift now for myself. 
If I scratch hard Ill fill my craw; 
if I don’t peck but loaf, I'll starve. 
I should feel sorry for myself, I think: 
I slave, yet I get nothing in return. 
The Pig just stuffs, then settles down to snore; 
he plays the fool and shirks all work for you. 
In countenance he looks so odd: 
outlandish, yes, so foreign to this earth! 
Though he’s no pet, he’s pampered like a pet; 
his fodder costs as much as lawsuits cost. 
When fattened up, he merely romps and sports; 
hungry, he sprawls around and gnaws the sty.
Religiously, he eats three times a day— 
I’ve yet to see him miss a single meal! 
Is he some gem to love and treasure, or 
some stone-blind cripple, ripe for alms?” 
“You, Cockalorum, wag your beak no more 
or someday I, Pig, shall bite out your throat! 
The Master treats us as it pleases him— 
don’t you sneak up to him and tell on me. 
If life manhandles you, it serves you right— 
please leave me free to take my own sweet ease. 
Which one of all six household beasts 
outshines me, Pig, in gorgeous fat? 
When kings officiate at the Southern Shrine,?! 
I’m needed for the triple sacrifice.? 
Leave off your way of gabbling tommyrot— 
stop sneering at the way pigs eat or sleep. 
Look at betrothal vows or marriage rites— 
could they occur without a feast of pork? 
You go and beg the world upon your knees: 
without me, no one would approach your door! 
To settle feuds I play a foremost role— 
all hatreds melt in sight of my plump snout. 
A couple—the benighted man and wife— 
may come to blows and bash each other’s heads. 
The neighbors helter-skelter rush in there, 
but nobody can disembroil the two. 
Now bring me in, make me the centerpiece: 
all tangled webs will come unsnarled at once! 
But is that not the truth? 
Consider it and see. 
At weddings, funerals, all formal rites, 
I, Pig, boast pride of place and lead the way. 
You little bantam, you talk big, 
compelling me to straighten out some facts.        
But far be it from me to brag— 
I only strive to do what’s right. 
Pigs, too, repay their debts of gratitude;  
pigs, too, cast out all evils and all woes. 
Do we complain when they tear up our flesh? 
Do we lament when they grind down our bones? 
We shine in fealty to our lord— 
and we account at nothing our own lives.  
You, Rooster, crowed such bunk 
that you provoked this wrangle, this dispute.” 
The Master thereupon decides the case 
with utmost sense and sentiment: 
“The Rooster will accept a righteous death.  
The Pig will give his life for humankind. 
The tale, at leisure, is penned down 
to show the world in its true light.  
But still all this is said in jest— 
please read it if you wish, for fun and laughs.
