The marvelous neuter at Blue Creek
The world has always known this one word: love. 
Who, here below, can slip the Maker’s snare? 
Now ponder on the ways and works of fate: 
our Southern realm’s not far from fairyland. 
Think of those wondrous meetings in the past:  
first, Liu and Yiian; then later, P’ei and Chang.’ 
And lo, somebody climbed the Tower of Yang: 
his dreams of nuptial play were but a myth.”
West of the city lay Blue Creek, a scene 
of grass and flowers—what a charming sphere!  
A riot of spring peach blossoms and of autumn mums; 
pomegranates spat summer’s fire, plums hailed winter’s breath. 
Green rows of willows and green groves of pines; 
grass spread to herdmen’s paths, moss hid woodcutters’ tracks. 
It was a lonesome site of hills and streams—  
wind fluttered thin bamboos, rain fondled flowers. 
Under the Lé, when peace and concord reigned
there lived a peerless youth called Tran Tu Uyen.   
His parents’ virtues blessed him with good luck: 
why, who could rival him in looks or gifts? 
A boon from Heaven was his ready wit: 
still young, he reveled in a student’s joys. 
He strolled about and saw a lovely scene: 
a blend of wilderness and city life. 
Atop a knoll, he built his study-hut: 
old rush for walls and sparse bamboo for blinds. 
Butterflies’ dances and birds’ songs galore; 
a lamp and books, the wind and moon all round. 
Where else to find such lavish wealth for all? 
Hoards of mum gold and piles of lotus coins! 
Compare this with all other spots on earth: 
half wonderland and half a hermit’s home. 
Four gems enhanced his zest: he roved the sea’ 
of ancient saints and roamed the Muses’ grove.
The shuttle swung—the days and months whirled round: 
as plane trees dropped their leaves, the peaches blossomed forth. 
Behind the mulberry trees the sun sank fast:® 
his mother, then his father passed away. 
Alas for him who bore this flux and change, 
gazing on far white clouds, on yon blue hills. 
Under the twofold loss his shoulders sagged— 
Yen’s gourd was clean and empty: nothing left.? 
As summers went and autumns came by turns, 
sun pierced the shade, frost gathered round the porch. 
The skies froze at the wester’s breath: plums pined 
before the wind, the willows blanched with dew. 
The roof half bristled with uneven jags: 
thatch wattles stained by wind and rain-smeared limewashed walls. 
The scene was other than of old: parched mums 
along the hedge, foul lilies in the pond. 
As he met woes along his road, he grinned 
and hailed life’s boons or setbacks with good cheer. 
You win or lose as Heaven wills—he plumbed 
the sea of learning, and his sorrow ebbed. 
Plain rice for hunger, water for his thirst— 
can sparrows know what dreams an eagle dreams? 
His vow of yore weighed heavy on his mind: 
he’d at all costs acquit his manly debt. 
With brush and inkstone he spent happy hours: 
he praised West Lake, he sang of Fairy Hall."° 
The capital echoed with the poet’s name: 
he ranked with Li and Tu, matched Sun and Ts’ao.!! 
The bag of poems, slung across his back, 
could hold all streams or hills, all clouds or winds! 
Words decked with pearls! Thoughts blazoned on brocade! 
Gold tinkling on the ground! Crane flashing past the boat!2 
He only loved those women met in books— 
for years he had not sown the seed of jade."* 
A hovering skiff upon the stream of love— 
watching the moon, he’d clasp his lute and wait. 
Jade Lake observed a rite—the Buddha’s realm 
was all astir: now glowed the feast of spring. 
of wheels and horses raising clouds of dust. 
It swarmed with beaux and belles—a motley throng 
Enjoying spring, Ta Uyén went for a walk, 
his bag half filled with verse, his gourd with wine. 
While he, entranced, admired the Buddha’s world, 
the sun descended toward the western heights. 
The feast was over—one and all went home. 
Pear blossoms fell, swayed by the evening breeze. 
Beside the bridge, those groups of three or five 
might hide some nymph—what earthly eyes could tell? 
As he was lingering in the shadow of a tree, 
crimson leaf came flying with the breeze. 
He slowly read—the sense became quite clear: 
some lines of verse, a quatrain penned by hand. 
Perusing, he stayed dumbstruck for a while: 
“Who sent this flirting note to tease a man?” 
He was about to answer with some words 
when on the wind came wafting clouds of scent.
He saw a damsel there outside the gate 
with her cortege of waiting maids in tow. 
The lady was a marvel in his eyes: 
flower unblown, a moon just waxing full. 
Jade bracelets and gold hairpins shone on her— 
rainbow gown, a skirt of yellow silk. 
The gleam of jasper, and an orchid’s grace—charms fit 
to drown a fish aswim, to wing a bird in flight. 
She looked much fresher yet as she drew near, 
strewing faint hints of fragrance in her wake. 
Her eyes shot glints at him, suggesting spring— 
one glance, one whiff, and he fell deep in love! 
A youth as ardent as the student Chang,!® 
he’d met a charmer—what was he to do? 
She cast a glance, a tempting wave—it would have rocked 
heart of iron, let alone a man’s. 
If Heaven had not meant Tw Thi?c for love,!? 
could he have strayed and reached those fairy hills? 
The stranger his own heart already knew— 
he walked up to the swing and courted her: 
“Carried away by mirth, I’m making bold— 
forgive this shameful conduct toward a flower!” 
“This is the Buddha’s festival,” she said. 
“In his domain, forgiveness is the rule! 
The wind blows all away, both right and wrong— 
against you, sir, no blunder will be held.” 
The siren’s voice was music to his ears— 
near beauty’s ocean, waves of lust may surge. 
“T am a man with stillborn gifts,” he said. 
“May Charity shed her light on my true love! 
How can the Buddha’s garden lack for space? 
Open a little path and save me, please!” 
She answered, “Here the Golden Cord holds sway'®@— 
how dare you dally, uttering vulgar words? 
Dhyana’s a haven making room for all!?— 
its boat will ferry here benighted souls. 
But what a shame that near the Bodhi tree”° 
bee or butterfly comes hovering thus!" 
The Udumbara’s hung with golden bells
how dare a goldfinch perch thereon and chirp?” 
He listened, hushed, and heard the beauty out— 
his love, around her, wrapped a shield of scent. 
“Still lost on passion’s sea,” he said, “I shall 
redeem past deeds as I amend this life. 
What fate intends for us will be fulfilled
may Buddha tie us with the crimson thread.” 
Let his High Priest now wield the magic wand 
and raze the tower of sorrow to the ground. 
The pestle awaits the nymph of the Blue Bridge
what’s for the gods may land in human hands! 
Water and floating fern may someday meet?
across the river let’s now throw a bridge.”
As he kept dropping hints and wooing her, 
the nymph turned on her heel and mutely left. 
He followed her as far as Quang-Van Hall?°>— 
above the dancing branches rose the moon. 
Discreetly choosing words, the youth inquired: 
“Some purple mansion may be your abode. 
Or is your home some stream, if not some cloud? 
The winds of spring have blown you here, perchance? 
Show me the way to go there, if you please! 
Who’d reach Mount Jade and then return with naught?
I am so grateful for your kind concern, 
but who can tell what’s real from what’s unreal?” 
That said, she vanished, lost amid the pines— 
her fragrance lingered, but the bird had fled. 
Wind-borne, the phoenix soared to reach the skies— 
the nymph went home, but love she left on earth. 
He scanned the pageantry of rolling clouds, 
spellbound, bewitched, though far from fairyland.  
Still dazed, he groped by moonlight his way home. 
The pine-oil lamp burned low—yet he sought sleep. 
Her haunting image how could he forget? 
She lingered there, possessing all his dreams. 
The lovelorn butterfly longed for his flower. 
He yearned and pined—imagine, then, his gloom! 
At times, he strummed the zither, but the tune 
conjured up streams and hills, evoking her. 
His hand would play “A phoenix woos his mate”— 
did she, Wen-chiin, feel what Hsiang-ju now felt?2® 
At times, he tried to drink peach-blossom wine— 
before he’d drained the cup, it filled with tears. 
And with each sip, the fumes bedimmed his mind, 
stirring remembrance and arousing love. 
At times, he sat awake as cuckoo-birds 
wailed at the moon and bells tolled death of day. 
They jarred his nerves and wrenched his very guts. 
Could love burn out? Could lovelorn tears be stanched? 
At times, he languished in the moonglow, as 
geese sailed the night and orioles hymned the dawn.  
He watched the play of nature’s scenes and sounds— 
to whom could he confide his secret thoughts? 
Spring joy throughout the sky belonged to all— 
spring sorrow weighed upon one man alone. 
Love moved the student’s hand to pen a note— 
he sent his love sealed with the written plea: 
“OQ Moon, you favor love. Pray, part the clouds— 
for lovers cast a bridge amid the stars! 
I ask to see that blossom face to face— 
how can you fence a garden now, in spring?”
