I am one-half Chinese and one-half French:! 
as neither fish nor fowl, what should I do? 
I'd till the soil but don’t know how to plow. 
Id hold high office but have flunked from school. 
I’d buy and sell but run quite short of cash. 
I'd ply some trade but haven’t learned a skill. 
Well, Pll put up with being such a flop. 
This flop’s worth more than all of you, rank knaves! 
We’ve met in here—we know each other now. 
It hurts to ruminate, to voice these thoughts. 
The West’s great culture? Criminals and thugs. 
Children of gods and dragons? Jailbirds all. 
They’re not our betters—they hold guns in hand. 
We’re dumb and base—our pockets boast no sou. 
The world is whirling—men are sound asleep. 
I feel so mad, I’d crumple up the earth.
Light flickers on my shadow and myself. 
My thoughts snarl up about this thing or that. 
Imprisoned twice or thrice, I shall live long. 
Forty to fifty years—I’m still quite young. 
My mind roams far and wide—the world’s too small. 
Struggling with storm and dust, I’ll pass my days. 
To all our hills and streams I swore an oath— 
I wait for cockcrow, pillowed on my lance.!
Mourning Nguyen Thai Hoc and Nguyen Thi Giang
She mourns him
A bolt of lightning struck out of midair. 
I’m choking on my love—what can I say? 
Clouds dim amidst the blue—the sky stays dark. 
Teardrops are drenched with red—the sea runs blood. 
Your golden body they consigned to earth— 
my snow-pure heart I'll leave beneath the moon. 
In the hereafter we may meet again— 
among the shades shall we two someday smile?
His soul replies 
As I see you, my darling, I feel shame. 
Who made you come and meet with me so soon? 
We pledged we’d have each other, first and last; 
we swore to live together or to die. 
The world of dust keeps changing—weal or woe? 
A true-red heart stays firm as stone and steel. 
The rainstorm raves and rages—let it storm. 
We'll take our grief to Heaven’s court of law.  
We'll take our grief to Heaven’s court of law— 
we’ll calm the waves of outrage in our hearts. 
Your drops of blood still tinge the stream with red— 
my hands yet stink of debts unpaid to life. 
I swore I’d never live beneath their skies— 
this body Mother might have failed to bear. 
My darling, don’t you feel unhappy so— 
our souls stay strong, our spirits still wield power.
