38 The hibiscus
The water gleams and mirrors this red flower
It bears no stain for Buddha is its heart
At break of day it blooms by dusk it falls
O wondrous law A thing becomes nothing
39 The monastery on Mount HillandStream
Mountain of gods and river of fair nymphs
together they make up the HillandStream
Rocks heap upon more rocks some high some low
Waves surge at other waves roll after roll
Of wealth and want the Buddha’s realm steers clear
For fame and gain men’s sails scud up and down
Bong bongfrom far above a bell is heard
Beneath the cloister wander step by step
40 On reading the Buddha’s scriptures
The Buddha taught the Perfect Thusness Way
O blessings countless as the Ganges’ sands
The sun and moon whirl past and then come back
all plants and blossoms thrive to wither soon
The richest man will never have enough
a pauper thinks his lot the worst on earth
Within the heart there lies a fallow field
uproot its weeds and grow true wisdom’s flowers
41 Where gather mists and clouds
Where gather mists and clouds a happy world
Thick swirls of incense smoke wreathe Heaven’s Gate
The bell of Prajna chimes through vacant days
Amida’s sutras drone on quiet nights
Brooks sigh and sing like harps when rain has stopped
Birds chirp sweet melodies as sunshine dims
The Way lies not far offwhy toil for it
Bodhi bears fruit right here inside the heart
42 The morning bell at Tiéu Monastery
The stars about to fade are straggling east
a distant bell now tolls the night’s last watch
In peace the primal motive prompts the world
across the rivers speaks a lonely voice
Unsettled herons cry in windgirt groves
awakened ravens caw on moonlit trees
In every household folks have stirred from bed
the cock proclaiming daybreak crows and crows
43 Stepping out of the world
Gaze at the worlda tangled game of chess
Gaze hard peer closer see more dirt and filth
The morning bell drives off terrestrial thoughts
the midday clapper dashes mundane cares
Bright purple wearies eyescoarse cloth gives warmth
Rich fare will pallplain salt and greens delight
Walk up to Buddha’s altar and look back
the ocean of desire is roiled with mud
44 A song of sorrow inside the royal harem (Cung oan ngam khuc)
All through the moonlight sighs an autumn wind
her dancing gown feels frigid metalcold
Does Heaven hate a harem inmate so
that He’ll condemn her rosy cheeks to grief
Why has all her good fortune now turned bad
How can she bear to probe and search the past
What’s happened to destroy it all midway
She broods upon herself and mourns her plight
As she recalls created for the world
she was a rosebud flaunting its fresh hues
The flower has scarcely opened when it fades
like Lady Pan’s white silk in autumn chill
Her cheeks peach blossoms wrought their spell on men
her eyes two restless waves rocked city walls
A glimpse of her fair form behind the blinds
would rouse the very grass and trees to lust
Lovesmitten fish would sink to ocean depths
enamored birds would drop from heaven’s heights
Her scent divine would charm the moon and flowers
entrance Hsi Shih bewitch Ch’ang O herself
She could embroider rhymes outshining Li’s
or paint in brushstrokes far surpassing Wang’s
What mortal rivaled her at chess or wine
Both Indra and Liu Ling were her soul mates
She plucked the lute by moonlight like Ssuma°
she played the flute in autumn like Hsiaoshih’
And when she sang and waved her hands to dance
moon fairies doffed their rainbow garb and quit
Her gifts and looks were praised throughout the realm
and suitors swarmed like bees outside her gate
Even before they had set eyes on her
Ch’i Hsiian’s mad fever seized them like a storm
The vernal flower still kept its pistil sealed
the autumn moon had yet to shed its glow
Curtains like mists still screened her rosy room
pure fragrance yet suffused her secret bower
Against the peacock archers drew their bows
upon the star young nobles trained their gaze'°
Her garden was still fenced from butterflies
they saw the flower yet found no entranceway
Her heart though not of stone could not be moved
mere humans should presume to climb T’ient’ai
Her perfume was not meant for earthly dust
and no amount of gold could buy her smile
Why is the human realm arranged that way
How can fate’s red silk thread so tie your feet
Lying supine an arm across the brow
she ponders on what moves the world of dust
Oh for some drops from Kuan Yin’s willow branch
to cool and quench the fire inside her heart4
Existence is a dream The universe
fate’s engine works in cryptic baffling ways
A bite of food a sip of drinkeach act
however trivial is foreordained
So many stricken by a thousand blows
still walk the earth as bodies with dead souls
No wonder that delivered from the womb
you issue forth to utter piercing wails
You weep in sorrow for your human plight
Who’s staged this play of fortune’s ebb and flow
From childhood with white teeth till hoary age'4
from birth to death how often you must grieve
Thoughts of success and failure gray the head
to seesaw up and down inures the heart
Sick flesh falls prey to bitter painsthe burn
of hunger’s fire the knifesharp pang of cold
Feet race for fame or gain and gather mud
by sunscald wind and dust the face is tanned
You brood on bubbles in the sea of woe
and floating moss by shores of selfdeceit
Life yields an acrid taste that numbs the tongue
the rugged road you tread will scar your heels
As waves beyond the haven surge and fall
the skiff of foam and shadow bobs about
A wanton boy is he who made the world
For sport he’ll make us reach dry land and drown
In his huge furnace forging myniad things
he will transmute white clouds to bluish dogs1
Where dancers danced now spiders weave doors rot
where singers sang now crickets whine all night
All of a sudden thorns bestrew smooth earth
who’s dyed the human scene in shades of dusk
Riches entice the horseandcarriage set
the bait of honors lures grandees and lords
How void of substance is a Nank’o dream
Open your eyes and see bare empty hands
A garden where the peach and plum once thrived
now runs to waste all carpeted by moss
Above a yard where urns and bells once stood
the moon now comes to rest in drowsy haze
Those who must sail the sea of gain and fame
are buffeted like toys by wind and waves
Heaven has grasped all powers for weal or woe
allowing none a snippet of free choice
The world is spun to turn as Heaven bids
men grope their way like toddlers in the night
All trees and rocks are marked and marred by time
all birds and fish must dread fierce wind or rain
All flesh must share the common dismal lot
of transitory hills of shortlived flies
A lonesone bridge still squats on its old banks
an inn forlorn looms stark in autumn gusts
Raw wind and weather tell on hills and brooks
no leaf no flower escapes decay and fall
A shadow play’s unfolding there on stage
it hurts to watch the fleeting show of life
Of your full hundred years what will be left
A mound of earth all smothered by rank weeds
The road of life is paved with griefs and woes
why gladly hug your ties to dust or dirt
The mortal drama plays for all to see
why not through Dhyana seek release and cure
Cross Buddha’s gate and wander free at last
Sever for good the seven passions’ bonds
Why shoulder loads and carry burdens still
What joys in human love can you expect
For friendship take pure moonlight and cool breeze
for love adopt the Udumbara flower'
and raise the torch of Prajna Leave the world°
stay free of things and be a god on earth
She wished to dodge the Potter’s grasping hand
and somehow wriggle through the marriage noose
But Heaven would not let her have her way
round the peach blossom twined the red silk thread
A debt contracted in some earlier life
A fruit whose seed had long ago been sown
Or had she once in Heaven’s palace done
some deed she now must expiate on earth
All living creatures even birds and beasts
insensate beings tangle in love’s toils
Female and male as yin and yang unite
both earth and heaven will in wedlock merge
The Maker wants the sexes to conjoin
how can a human shy from human love
Stop struggling Look away don’t murmurwait
and see where destiny will set you down
How careless was that Old Man of the Moon
He let his red silk thread wind round her feet
What was that night the night she met her lord
Over a rose in bloom the sun went down
A thirstscorched peony waited for the rain
a spellbound orchid waked and dreamed by turns
In the spring night the springborn blossom smiled
and welcomed caresses from the east wind
Her rainbow skirt lay tattered windexposed
her feather jacket gleamed beneath the moon
The flutes and singers sang sweet melodies
Hsi Shih climbed step by step up Kusu Tower
The halcyon couch gave off faint whiffs of musk
the moonlit jewels shimmered round her neck
From clouds in rites of love raindrops poured down
to bless the peony there in Scentwood Hall
Clear notes of lute inside the skyblue room
soft moans of flute throughout the crimson yard
The music grew enrapturing her soul
it surged and soaredher heart went numb with bliss
Motheyebrows brushed against the dragon’s face5
they formed a perfect couple side by side
Upon the queen of flowers the king of men
conferred the world’s rewards to beauty due
She nestled to the sun enthroned above
she waited on his pleasure night and day
They loved each otherfire and incense glowed
no need to strew mulberry leaves for goats°
On moonbright balconies they hugged and kissed
in sunny maple groves they laughed and played
Her fresh pearblossom face bewitched his eyes
he cherished her unpainted unadorned
The flawless gem that flashed a hundred sparks
was fondled pampered by a king in love
A woman’s beauty Soulentrancing drug
toppler of kingdoms shaker of the world
They listened to Clear Moonlight at West Park
they heard Fair Harem Flower up in Spring Tower
By royal grace she shared his bed till dawn
jade and vermilion glimmered through the dark
To lie inside those curtains of brocade
and snuggle close to him the lord supreme
Offer to pay a thousand coins in gold
and try to purchase one such spring night’s dream
Now she would smile now she would purse her brows
when teased about her goldenlotus feet7
She flounced and flirted with consummate art
as would befit a goddess born to earth
Some orchids grow unnoticed in the wilds
their scent not treasured by a prince or duke
But fickle destiny had chosen her
and given her a king to love and serve
her parents who had tutted at her birth
forgave her now for being just a girl
Paintings of lovebirds flying wing to wing
of flowers that bloom on intertwining boughs2°
she etched those union symbols in her heart
and vowed eternal troth on Seventh Night°
A drop of rain had fallen by sheer luck
into a stately mansionshe rejoiced
that fish and water meant to meet had met
She relished her position more and more
delighted with her fortune and well pleased
her hand had dipped in royal indigo
Some years went pasthis ardor slowly cooled
the wellspring somehow started running dry
Heaven will shiftone morning she woke up
and found the sovereign’s love for her had died
If royal grace and justice be a torch
let it shine forth and reach the farthest nooks
A thousand roses vie in coloryet
the lord will choose and pluck those near at hand
When many anglers angle for one fish
the glutted fish stops nibbling at the bait
When many swallows flock to one lone tree
how can a branch be found whereon to perch
She’d hoped to fare far better than the rest
and lastinstead the Maker played a prank
no sooner had the sun bestowed warm light
than this deep grotto plunged back into dark
Inside the silent chamber all alone
she’s waiting hour by hour the livelong night
Why act so wantonly O Lord of Spring
You play with flowers but leave before they fade
Here on this tower where once they watched the moon
she stirs and frets away a night of rain
Beside the terrace where they breathed the cool
she lies awake while howls the autumn gale
Her room feels metalcoldbroken in two
their phoenix mirror split their common sash
Mornings and nights she broods and dreams of love
like one who slumbered under that plum tree
Or she imagines she’s a butterfly
that flutters to and fro like some lost soul
Her alcove’s hushed and stillthrough crimson doors
winds pierce to ivory blinds dew clings
The phoenix coach the goatdrawn cart are gone
they’ve left grasscovered tracks mossspeckled ruts
The harem lies immersed in autumn dusk
her mat and pillow freeze in solitude
All day she waits for newsno wild goose comes
all night she hears bells tollno other sound
It’s cold to sleep alone as incense wafts
and lamplight flickers in the shadowed night
Portraits of beauties she admires no more
gray eyes she fastens on the royal hall
All by herself unseen she grieves and mourns
complaining to the moon sighing with flowers
A hundred torments gnaw within her heart
beset by care she staggers in a daze
How can the butterfly forsake the flower
and let her petals fade her pistil wilt
Deep into night she gazes at the moon
Who has invented this the grief that kills
No whetted sword is used to kill the girl
she’s killed with sorrow what a cruel way
Why spin your thread Old Codger of the Moon
if you don’t bind two lovers hard and fast
She would as soon yank loose the red silk thread
kick down the harem gate and flee outside
They strolled here in this garden where years past
he plucked the red peach blossom in its prime
Up Phoenix Terrace down Oriole Bower
twin pillows lie where both dreamed wondrous dreams
But now contempt has settled in his heart
he lets her wilt like grass and fray like silk
Sun king of love why do you feel no love
The flower regrets lost spring as wanes the moon
Where is the royal hall of yesteryear
when he broke off the tender willow spray
Behind pearlstudded veils and ivory blinds
her bridal gown still bears the marks of love
But now he’s cast her from his fickle heart
to let the blossom float and drift downstream
Creator why play these capricious tricks
The pallid moon sets on a life laid waste
A flower adrift beneath the waning moon
the smoldering fire of twilight burns her soul
More twilight yet more twilight looms ahead
she sorrows for the flower and for the moon
Who cares to glorify a waning moon
Who bothers to admire a fallen flower
In cheerless nature grief finds no reprieve
grief mirrors nature nature mirrors grief
While leaves are rustling stirred by gusts of wind
she thinks she hears faint voices from afar
His coach is coming Hurriedly she burns
stale incense and perfumes her musty robe
Alas the voices heard are crickets’ cries
sad autumn’s whispers to all lovelorn hearts
No tidings break the hushbonechilled she waits
by her cold window fireflies flit about
When over her high roof the moon slopes down
she thinks she hears a call that summons her
He’s sent a page for her With moldy powder
she quickly touches up her withered cheeks
Alas she’s heard a cuckoo’s stubborn wail
it mourns all widows and defunct spring joys
She feels so coldno one is hugging her
Bleak sorrow floods the yard where blossoms fall
In Halcyon Palace laughter turns to tears
all pomp and glory dazzle but soon dim
Dry rot eats gates of powerif she had known
she’d have preferred the simple humdrum life
Had she suspected Heaven wished her ill
she’d have rebuffed the lure of gold itself
She broods on destiny and she despairs
The flower has left its branchwhat can be done
Rich viands fit for princes will soon pall
plain greens and beans taste bland yet always please
To live together under one thatch roof
with children big and smallthat’s happiness
Had she but known what fate reserved for her
would she have acted proud and hard to please
She would have settled for some country lad
and quashed all dreams of grandeur from her soul
Her haggard face is like to that gaunt moon
her glassy eyes resembles this dim lamp
She wants to laugh and sing her grief away
her laughs all sound like sobs her songs like moans
The heart’s dull fire has parched her lovely brows
the tears of blood have washed rouge from her face
Her sorrow mars or kills all little joys
tea freshly brewed fine incense or rare scent
He lives close by yet seems a world away
Why such a destiny She fares far worse
than do the Herdboy and his Weaver Maid4
they see each other every autumn once
Endowed with charm and beauty she must wait
year after year inside her empty room
Is she not meant for him Oh for red dye
to dye again the faded thread of silk
The royal flowers smile to greet the sun
who would forbid the bee to come their way
A shallow stream keeps her and him apart
he’s over there she’s waiting over here
A languor blurs her senses eyes and ears
The vacant chamber rouses thoughts of love
In dreams she lives those nights of long ago
she yearns and thirsts for raindrops after drought
Upon his lofty throne is he aware
A woman’s left forlorn and cold unloved
East wind why scorn the peach bloom and veer off
to let her pine and wither in her nook
The Maker wields a wayward handfor fun
he’s locked her in a prison made of gold
As she sits here and broods about the world
she feels like bursting into one long scream
She’s cold left by herselfthey lie near him
Yet has she lost all beauty and all charm
You play such jokes Old Codger of the Moon
From strong red yarn you’ve spun a thin pale thread
Her weary soul is deadened to all things
her anguished thoughts all snarl like sleaves of silk
Upon the lamp that lit their nuptial night
twin flowers of wedded troth still bloom intact
Have many state affairs so troubled him
that he’s expelled her from his mind and heart
Why has her servant failed to bring her plight
to his full notice seeking some redress
Night wind and raina woman cold alone
Raindrops tap plantain leaves to beat each watch
A few fireflies wink feebly by the wall
now clouded by dawn’s mist The lamp’s grown dim
the clock’s dripped low she has not closed her eyes°
This melancholy viewshe hates it so
What name to give this sadness In one night
how many scenes recalled and seen again
Fleet time white stallion gallops past her blind
when will they ever end her pain and grief
Perhaps her plaint will move the sovereign’s ear
oh may her face stay fresh as in those days
45 Calling all souls (Chieu hon)
Throughout the seventh month rain sobs and wails
The chill of wind gnaws into aged bones
An autumn eveningwhat a dismal scene
Reeds drown in silver plane trees strew gold leaves
Among the poplars twilight lingers still
Upon the pear trees drop by drop dew falls
Whose heart would not feel sorrow at this sight
And if the living mourn what of the dead
Out of the darkness shrouding sky and earth
let specters ghosts and phantoms all appear
All creatures of ten classes pity them
Lost lonely souls they wander in strange lands
They find no home where votive incense burns
forlorn they prowl and prowl from night to night
They once sat high or lowwhat matter now
Can you now tell the sages from the fools
As autumn starts let’s set an altar up
Pure water sprinkles from the willow branch
May Buddha’s mercy heal those suffering souls
save them and guide them toward the Promised West
There were proud men who followed glory’s path
they warred and hoped to conquer all the world
Why talk about the heyday of their might
Remember their decline their fall and grieve
A storm broke forththeir roofs came crashing down
could they trade places with the meanest boor
For pride and pomp breed hatred and revenge
blood flowed in streams bones crumbled into bits
Killed young they’ve left no heirthey drift unmourned
as headless ghosts that moan on nights of rain
Defeat or triumph lies in Heaven’s scheme
will ever those lost souls escape their fate
Where are those ladies veiled by flowered drapes
who reigned supreme in cassiascented bowers
Once more the realm changed mastershapless leaves
did they know where they’d go swept off by winds
From lofty towers they toppled into waves
the hairpin snapped in two the pitcher sank
A merry court had flocked round them in life
once their eyes closed none gathered up their bones
Alas no incense burns to keep them warm
they hide in thickets or they skulk near brooks
Oh pity their soft hands their tender feet
They wilt night after night rot year by year
Those who once wore tall hats and waved broad sleeves
meted out life and death with their red brush
To rulethey did know how their pockets stuck
with statecraft handbooks like so many knives
they’d read Yi Yin the Duke of Chou by day
study Kuan Chung or Chuko Liang at night
Higher they climbed more hatred they inspired
creating all round more tombs more ghosts
No gold on earth can ransom back their lives
Their halls lie shattered where gay songs once rang
No kinsfolk stay close by to offer them
a bowl of water or an incense stick
Deserted souls they stagger here and there
far from salvation loaded down with guilt
There were those who mapped plans and marshaled troops
They rushed to battle seized batons and seals
They raged like windstorms roared like thunderbolts
many laid down their lives for one man’s sake
Stray arrows errant bullets spelled their doom
they squandered flesh and blood on battlegrounds
Stranded and waifed upon some distant shore
where could they find a grave poor bones none claimed
All through the sky’s abyss rain wails wind howls
the mists of darkness blur and dim the world
Forests and fields wear mourning shades of gray
the castoff dead receive no sacrifice
There were those who once hankered after wealth
They traded losing sleep and appetite
Estranged from kith and kin they had no friend
to whom could they bequeath their hardearned goods
Who would be there to hear their dying words
All earthly riches come and go like clouds
now dead they could not take one coin with them
The neighbors squeezing out some ritual tears
dumped them in coffins made of banyan wood
and buried them by torchlight after dark
Bewildered at a loss they roam the fields
where is an incense stick a drop of drink
There were those scholars chasing post and rank
they’d all trek into town and try their luck
In fall they would pack up and leave their homes
to go and measure pens with fellow scribes
But was officialdom their cherished goal
a cause worth risking soul and body for
When they took sick bedridden at some inn
they lacked their wives’ and children’s loving care
Without ado they were consigned to earth
while strangers and no brothers would look on
Far far away from their ancestral soil
their corpses dot unhallowed burial grounds
Unwarmed by fire and incense exiled souls
must shiver as winds blow beneath the moon
There were those travelers roving streams and seas
whose sails unfurled and dared the east’s fierce gusts
A tempest rose and struck them in midcourse
they met their end inside the maws of sharks
There were those who strolled round and peddled wares
their shoulders mangled by the carrying pole
As they fell victim to harsh sun or rain
where did they wend their way souls turned adrift
There were those who enlisted by main force
left their beloved to go serve the state
With water scooped from brooks rice kept in tubes
they trudged along rainswept windbeaten trails
In wartime human life is cheap as trash
stray bullets and chance arrows smote them down
Willo’thewisps they flutter to and fro
as night skies echo with their piteous moans
There were poor girls whom fortune failed in need
they sold their charms and threw their youth away
Old age caught them alone and desolate
unmarried childless where could they seek help
Alive they drained the cup of bitter dregs
and dead they eat rice mush from banyan leaves°
How sorrowful is women’s destiny
Who can explain why they are born to grief
There were those wretches tramping all the year
a bridge served as their roof hard ground their bed
They too belonged to humankindalas
they lived on alms and died beside back roads
Some got locked up in jail for no offense
they languished clad in tattered mats and died
Their bones were tucked in nooks of prison camps
When will they ever have their wrongs set right
Some children newborn at a baleful hour
had to forsake their parents and pass on
Who’s now to hold them walk and play with them
Their strangled cries and wails distress the heart
And there were those who drowned in streams or lakes
those who climbed trees and fell when their foot slipped
Some tumbled down deep wells when their rope broke
Some washed away in floods some burned in fires
Some perished by wolves’ fangs or elephants’ tusks
a prey to monsters of the hills or seas
Some women bore a child but left it soon
and some alas miscarried of their babe
Along the way all tripped and fell head first
to cross the Bridge of No Return one after one’
Those persons bound for separate destinies
stray souls and vagrant ghostswhere are they now
They crouch against a dike behind a bush
They dwell where rivers spring where earth meets sky
They lurk in clumps of grass in shade of trees
They hover near this hostel haunt that bridge
They find asylum at some shrine some church
They make abode in market towns and ports
They clamber up and down some mounds or knolls
They wade all through the mire of bogs or swamps
After a life of agonies and woes
bowels and guts have shriveled numb with cold
For scores of years they’ve suffered gales and storms
moaning they eat and sleep on dirt or dew
By cockcrow frightened they all flee and hide
at sunset they all venture forth again
In rags they all slink out hugging their young
or steering by the hand their tottery old
All wandering damned souls both old and young
For your salvation come and hear a prayer
May Buddha rescue you from life and death
and ferry you to his Pure Land of Bliss
Let his effulgent light dispel such gloom
as clouds the mind in ignorance and sin
Then over all four seas his peace shall reign
to soothe all griefs and purge all enmity
May Buddha’s power send the Wheel of the Law
through all three realms to all ten cardinal points
The BurntFaced King shall raise his holy flag
and lead all creatures on their joyous march
May Buddha work his magic and awake
all beings from the dream of selfdeceit
All creatures of ten classes are you there
Women and men you young and old all come
All enter Buddha’s house and hear his word
This life is just a bubble or a flash
O friends make room for Buddha in your hearts
and you'll escape the cycle of rebirths
At his behest we set a bowl of gruel
and incense candles on the hallowed board
We offer paper gold and paper clothes
to help you speed your heavenward ascent
All who have come be seated and partake
spurn not these trifles gifts of our goodwill
By Buddha’s grace they’ll grow a millionfold
and all of you shall get your even share
To all he brings compassion and release
no longer fear the curse of life and death
Buddha the Law the Orderall be praised
Glory to those who sit on lotus thrones
