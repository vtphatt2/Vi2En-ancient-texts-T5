A song of sorrow inside the royal harem
All through the moonlight sighs an autumn wind: 
her dancing gown feels frigid, metal-cold. 
Does Heaven hate a harem inmate so 
that He’ll condemn her rosy cheeks to grief? 
Why has all her good fortune now turned bad?  
How can she bear to probe and search the past? 
What’s happened to destroy it all midway? 
She broods upon herself and mourns her plight. 
As she recalls, created for the world, 
she was a rosebud flaunting its fresh hues.  
The flower has scarcely opened when it fades 
Lady Pan’s white silk fades in autumn chill. 
Her cheeks, peach blossoms, wrought their spell on men; 
her eyes, two restless waves, rocked city walls. 
A glimpse of her fair form behind the blinds  
would rouse the very grass and trees to lust. 
Love-smitten fish would sink to ocean depths; 
enamored birds would drop from heaven’s heights.  
Her scent divine would charm the moon and flowers, 
entrance Hsi Shih, bewitch Ch’ang O herself.” 
She could embroider rhymes outshining Li’s 
or paint in brushstrokes far surpassing Wang’s. 
What mortal rivaled her at chess or wine? 
Both Indra and Liu Ling were her soul mates. 
She plucked the lute by moonlight like Ssu-ma; 
she played the flute in autumn like Hsiao-shih.’ 
And when she sang and waved her hands to dance, 
moon fairies doffed their rainbow garb and quit. 
Her gifts and looks were praised throughout the realm, 
and suitors swarmed like bees outside her gate. 
Even before they had set eyes on her, 
Ch’i Hsiian’s mad fever seized them like a storm. 
The vernal flower still kept its pistil sealed; 
the autumn moon had yet to shed its glow. 
Curtains like mists still screened her rosy room; 
pure fragrance yet suffused her secret bower. 
Against the peacock, archers drew their bows;? 
upon the star young nobles trained their gaze.' 
Her garden was still fenced from butterflies— 
they saw the flower, yet found no entranceway. 
Her heart, though not of stone, could not be moved— 
mere humans should presume to climb T’ien-t’ai!!! 
Her perfume was not meant for earthly dust, 
and no amount of gold could buy her smile. 
Why is the human realm arranged that way? 
How can fate’s red silk thread so tie your feet?!” 
Lying supine, an arm across the brow, 
Oh, for some drops from Kuan Yin’s willow branch to cool and quench the fire inside her heart! 
Existence is a dream. 
The universe, fate’s engine, works in cryptic, baffling ways.         
A bite of food, a sip of drink—each act, 
however trivial, is foreordained. 
So many, stricken by a thousand blows, 
still walk the earth as bodies with dead souls. 
No wonder that delivered from the womb, 
you issue forth to utter piercing wails! 
You weep in sorrow for your human plight. 
Who’s staged this play of fortune’s ebb and flow? 
From childhood with white teeth till hoary age, 
from birth to death, how often you must grieve! 
Thoughts of success and failure gray the head; 
to seesaw up and down inures the heart. 
Sick flesh falls prey to bitter pains—the burn 
of hunger’s fire, the knife-sharp pang of cold. 
Feet race for fame or gain and gather mud— 
by sunscald, wind, and dust the face is tanned. 
You brood on bubbles in the sea of woe, 
and floating moss by shores of self-deceit 
Life yields an acrid taste that numbs the tongue; 
the rugged road you tread will scar your heels. 
As waves beyond the haven surge and fall, 
the skiff of foam and shadow bobs about. 
A wanton boy is he who made the world! 
For sport he’ll make us reach dry land and drown. 
In his huge furnace forging myniad things, 
he will transmute white clouds to bluish dogs 
Where dancers danced, now spiders weave, doors rot; 
where singers sang, now crickets whine all night. 
All of a sudden, thorns bestrew smooth earth— 
who’s dyed the human scene in shades of dusk? 
Riches entice the horse-and-carriage set; 
the bait of honors lures grandees and lords. 
How void of substance is a Nan-k’o dream!! 
Open your eyes and see bare, empty hands.         
A garden where the peach and plum once thrived 
the moon now comes to rest in drowsy haze. 
Those who must sail the sea of gain and fame 
are buffeted like toys by wind and waves. 
Heaven has grasped all powers for weal or woe, 
allowing none a snippet of free choice. 
The world is spun to turn as Heaven bids— 
men grope their way like toddlers in the night. 
All trees and rocks are marked and marred by time; 
all birds and fish must dread fierce wind or rain. 
All flesh must share the common, dismal lot 
of transitory hills, of short-lived flies. 
A lonesone bridge still squats on its old banks; 
an inn, forlorn, looms stark in autumn gusts. 
Raw wind and weather tell on hills and brooks; 
no leaf, no flower escapes decay and fall. 
A shadow play’s unfolding there on stage: 
it hurts to watch the fleeting show of life. 
Of your full hundred years what will be left? 
A mound of earth all smothered by rank weeds! 
The road of life is paved with griefs and woes: 
why gladly hug your ties to dust or dirt? 
The mortal drama plays for all to see: 
why not through Dhyana seek release and cure??? 
Cross Buddha’s gate and wander free at last. 
Sever for good the seven passions’ bonds.! 
Why shoulder loads and carry burdens still? 
What joys in human love can you expect? 
For friendship, take pure moonlight and cool breeze; 
for love, adopt the Udumbara flower, 
and raise the torch of Prajna. Leave the world:” 
stay free of things and be a god on earth!         
She wished to dodge the Potter’s grasping hand 
and somehow wriggle through the marriage noose. 
But Heaven would not let her have her way— 
round the peach blossom twined the red silk thread. 
A debt contracted in some earlier life? 
A fruit whose seed had long ago been sown? 
Or had she once in Heaven’s palace done 
some deed she now must expiate on earth? 
All living creatures, even birds and beasts, 
insensate beings, tangle in love’s toils. 
Female and male as yin and yang unite— 
both earth and heaven will in wedlock merge. 
The Maker wants the sexes to conjoin: 
how can a human shy from human love? 
Stop struggling! Look away, don’t murmur—wait 
and see where destiny will set you down. 
How careless was that Old Man of the Moon!?! 
He let his red silk thread wind round her feet. 
What was that night, the night she met her lord? 
Over a rose in bloom the sun went down. 
A thirst-scorched peony waited for the rain; 
a spell-bound orchid waked and dreamed by turns. 
In the spring night, the spring-born blossom smiled 
and welcomed caresses from the east wind.?” 
Her rainbow skirt lay tattered, wind-exposed; 
her feather jacket gleamed beneath the moon. 
The flutes and singers sang sweet melodies— 
Hsi Shih climbed step by step up Ku-su Tower!? 
The halcyon couch gave off faint whiffs of musk; 
the moonlit jewels shimmered round her neck. 
From clouds, in rites of love, raindrops poured down 
to bless the peony there in Scentwood Hall.” 
Clear notes of lute inside the sky-blue room; 
soft moans of flute throughout the crimson yard.        
The music grew, enrapturing her soul; 
it surged and soared—her heart went numb with bliss. 
Moth-eyebrows brushed against the dragon’s face: 
they formed a perfect couple, side by side. 
Upon the queen of flowers the king of men 
conferred the world’s rewards to beauty due. 
She nestled to the sun enthroned above; 
she waited on his pleasure night and day. 
They loved each other—fire and incense glowed: 
no need to strew mulberry leaves for goats!” 
On moon-bright balconies they hugged and kissed; 
in sunny maple groves they laughed and played. 
Her fresh pear-blossom face bewitched his eyes— 
he cherished her unpainted, unadorned. 
The flawless gem that flashed a hundred sparks 
was fondled, pampered by a king in love. 
A woman’s beauty! Soul-entrancing drug, 
toppler of kingdoms, shaker of the world! 
They listened to “Clear Moonlight” at West Park; 
they heard “Fair Harem Flower” up in Spring Tower. 
By royal grace, she shared his bed till dawn— 
jade and vermilion glimmered through the dark. 
To lie inside those curtains of brocade 
and snuggle close to him, the lord supreme! 
Offer to pay a thousand coins, in gold, 
and try to purchase one such spring night’s dream! 
Now she would smile, now she would purse her brows 
when teased about her golden-lotus feet. 
She flounced and flirted with consummate art 
as would befit a goddess born to earth! 
Some orchids grow unnoticed in the wilds,? 
their scent not treasured by a prince or duke. 
But fickle destiny had chosen her 
and given her a king to love and serve:         
Paintings of lovebirds flying wing to wing, 
of flowers that bloom on intertwining boughs 
she etched those union symbols in her heart 
and vowed eternal troth on Seventh Night. 
A drop of rain had fallen, by sheer luck, into a stately mansion—she rejoiced 
that fish and water, meant to meet, had met.  
She delighted with her fortune and well pleased 
her hand had dipped in royal indigo.!  
Some years went past—his ardor slowly cooled; 
the wellspring, somehow, started running dry. 
Heaven will shift—one morning she woke up 
and found the sovereign’s love for her had died. 
If royal grace and justice be a torch,  
let it shine forth and reach the farthest nooks! 
A thousand roses vie in color—yet 
the lord will choose and pluck those near at hand. 
When many anglers angle for one fish, 
the glutted fish stops nibbling at the bait.  
When many swallows flock to one lone tree, 
how can a branch be found whereon to perch? 
She’d hoped to fare far better than the rest 
and last—instead, the Maker played a prank: 
no sooner had the sun bestowed warm light than this deep grotto plunged back into dark. 
Inside the silent chamber, all alone, 
she’s waiting hour by hour the livelong night. 
Why act so wantonly, O Lord of Spring? 
You play with flowers, but leave before they fade.  
Here on this tower where once they watched the moon, she stirs and frets away a night of rain. 
Beside the terrace where they breathed the cool, she lies awake while howls the autumn gale. 
Her room feels metal-cold—broken in two, 
their phoenix mirror; split, their common sash. 
Mornings and nights, she broods and dreams of love 
Or she imagines she’s a butterfly that flutters to and from like some lost soul. 
Her alcove’s hushed and still—through crimson doors, winds pierce, to ivory blinds dew clings. 
The phoenix coach, the goat-drawn cart are gone— 
they’ve left grass-covered tracks, moss-speckled ruts. 
The harem lies immersed in autumn dusk— 
her mat and pillow freeze in solitude. 
All day she waits for news—no wild goose comes; 
all night she hears bells toll—no other sound. 
It’s cold to sleep alone as incense wafts 
and lamplight flickers in the shadowed night. 
Portraits of beauties she admires no more— 
gray eyes she fastens on the royal hall. 
All by herself, unseen, she grieves and mourns, 
complaining to the moon, sighing with flowers. 
A hundred torments gnaw within her heart; 
beset by care, she staggers in a daze. 
How can the butterfly forsake the flower 
and let her petals fade, her pistil wilt? 
Deep into night, she gazes at the moon. 
Who has invented this, the grief that kills? 
No whetted sword is used to kill the girl— 
she’s killed with sorrow: what a cruel way! 
Why spin your thread, Old Codger of the Moon, 
if you don’t bind two lovers hard and fast? 
She would as soon yank loose the red silk thread,         
kick down the harem gate and flee outside. 
They strolled here in this garden where, years past, 
he plucked the red peach blossom in its prime. 
Up Phoenix Terrace, down Oriole Bower, 
twin pillows lie where both dreamed wondrous dreams. 
But now contempt has settled in his heart— 
he lets her wilt like grass and fray like silk. 
Sun king of love, why do you feel no love? 
The flower regrets lost spring as wanes the moon. 
Where is the royal hall of yesteryear, 
when he broke off the tender willow spray? 
Behind pearl-studded veils and ivory blinds, 
her bridal gown still bears the marks of love. 
But now he’s cast her from his fickle heart 
to let the blossom float and drift downstream. 
Creator, why play these capricious tricks? 
The pallid moon sets on a life laid waste. 
A flower adrift beneath the waning moon— 
the smoldering fire of twilight burns her soul. 
More twilight, yet more twilight looms ahead— 
she sorrows for the flower and for the moon. 
Who cares to glorify a waning moon? 
Who bothers to admire a fallen flower? 
In cheerless nature grief finds no reprieve— 
grief mirrors nature, nature mirrors grief. 
While leaves are rustling, stirred by gusts of wind, 
she thinks she hears faint voices from afar. 
His coach is coming! Hurriedly she burns 
stale incense and perfumes her musty robe. 
Alas, the voices heard are crickets’ cries, 
sad autumn’s whispers to all lovelorn hearts. 
No tidings break the hush—bone-chilled, she waits; 
by her cold window, fireflies flit about. 
When over her high roof the moon slopes down,        
she thinks she hears a call that summons her. 
He’s sent a page for her! With moldy powder, 
she quickly touches up her withered cheeks. 
Alas, she’s heard a cuckoo’s stubborn wail— 
it mourns all widows and defunct spring joys. 
She feels so cold—no one is hugging her. 
Bleak sorrow floods the yard where blossoms fall. 
In Halcyon Palace, laughter turns to tears: 
all pomp and glory dazzle but soon dim. 
Dry rot eats gates of power—if she had known, 
she’d have preferred the simple, humdrum life. 
Had she suspected Heaven wished her ill, 
she’d have rebuffed the lure of gold itself. 
She broods on destiny, and she despairs. 
The flower has left its branch—what can be done? 
Rich viands, fit for princes, will soon pall: 
plain greens and beans taste bland, yet always please. 
To live together under one thatch roof 
with children big and small—that’s happiness! 
Had she but known what fate reserved for her, 
would she have acted proud and hard to please? 
She would have settled for some country lad 
and quashed all dreams of grandeur from her soul. 
Her haggard face is like to that gaunt moon; 
her glassy eyes resembles this dim lamp. 
She wants to laugh and sing her grief away— 
her laughs all sound like sobs, her songs like moans. 
The heart’s dull fire has parched her lovely brows; 
the tears of blood have washed rouge from her face. 
Her sorrow mars or kills all little joys: 
tea freshly brewed, fine incense, or rare scent. 
He lives close by, yet seems a world away. 
Why such a destiny? She fares far worse 
than do the Herdboy and his Weaver Maid:         
they see each other every autumn once. 
Endowed with charm and beauty, she must wait 
year after year inside her empty room. 
Is she not meant for him? Oh, for red dye 
to dye again the faded thread of silk! 
The royal flowers smile to greet the sun— 
who would forbid the bee to come their way? 
A shallow stream keeps her and him apart— 
he’s over there, she’s waiting over here. 
A languor blurs her senses, eyes, and ears. 
The vacant chamber rouses thoughts of love. 
In dreams she lives those nights of long ago— 
she yearns and thirsts for raindrops after drought. 
Upon his lofty throne is he aware? 
A woman’s left forlorn and cold, unloved. 
East wind, why scorn the peach bloom and veer off, 
to let her pine and wither in her nook? 
The Maker wields a wayward hand—for fun 
he’s locked her in a prison made of gold! 
As she sits here and broods about the world, 
she feels like bursting into one long scream. 
She’s cold, left by herself—they lie near him! 
Yet has she lost all beauty and all charm? 
You play such jokes, Old Codger of the Moon! 
From strong red yarn you’ve spun a thin, pale thread. 
Her weary soul is deadened to all things— 
her anguished thoughts all snarl like sleaves of silk. 
Upon the lamp that lit their nuptial night, 
twin flowers of wedded troth still bloom, intact. 
Have many state affairs so troubled him 
that he’s expelled her from his mind and heart? 
Why has her servant failed to bring her plight 
to his full notice, seeking some redress? 
Night, wind, and rain—a woman, cold, alone.         
Raindrops tap plantain leaves to beat each watch. 
A few fireflies wink feebly by the wall, 
now clouded by dawn’s mist. The lamp’s grown dim,  
the clock’s dripped low: she has not closed her eyes. 
This melancholy view—she hates it so! 
What name to give this sadness? In one night, 
how many scenes recalled and seen again! 
Fleet time, white stallion, gallops past her blind:  
when will they ever end, her pain and grief? 
Perhaps, her plaint will move the sovereign’s ear— 
oh, may her face stay fresh as in those days!
