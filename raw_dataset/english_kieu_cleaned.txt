A hundred, years in this life span on earth
talent and destiny are apt to feud
You must go through a play of ebb and flow
and watch such things as make you sick at heart
Is it so strange that losses balance gains?
Blue Heaven's wont to strike a rose from spite
By lamplight turn these scented leaves and read
a tale of love recorded in old books
Under the Chia ching reign when Ming held sway,
all lived at peace both capitals stood strong
There was a burgher in the clan of Virong
a man of modest wealth and middle rank
He had a last born son, Vương Quan his hope
to carry on a line of learned folk
Two daughters, beauties both, had come before:
Thúy Kiều was oldest, younger was Thúy Vin
Bodies like slim plum branches, snow pure souls
each her own self, each perfect in her way
In quiet grace Van was beyond compare:
her face a moon, her eyebrows two full curves;
her smile a flower, her voice the song of jade;
her hair the sheen of clouds, her skin white snow
Yet Kiều possessed a keener, deeper charm,
surpassing Vain in talents and in looks
Her eyes were autumn streams, her brows spring hill
Flowers grudged her glamour, willows her fresh hue
A glance or two from her, and kingdoms rocked!
Supreme in looks, she had few peers in gifts
By Heaven blessed with wit, she knew all skills:
she could write verse and paint, could sing and chant
Of music she had mastered all five tones
and played the lute far better than Ai Chang
She had composed a song called Cruel Fare
to mourn all women in soul rending strains
A paragon of grace for womanhood,
she neared that time when maidens pinned their hair
She calmly lived behind drawn shades and drapes,
as wooers swarmed, unheeded, by the wall
Swift swallows and spring days were shuttling by
of ninety radiant ones three score had fled
Young grass spread all its green to heaven's Ti
some blossoms marked pear branches with white dots
Now came the Feast of Light in the third month
with graveyard rites and junkets on the green
As merry pilgrims flocked from near and far,
the sisters and their brother went for a stroll
Fine men and beauteous women on parade:
a crush of clothes, a rush of wheels and steeds
Folks clambered burial knolls to strew and burn
sham gold or paper coins, and ashes swirled
Now, as the sun was dipping toward the west,
the youngsters started homeward, hand in hand
With leisured steps they walked along a brook,
admiring here and there a pretty view
The rivulet, babbling, curled and wound its course
under a bridge that spanned it farther down
Beside the road a mound of earth loomed up
where withered weeds, half yellow and half green
Kiều asked: Now that the Feast of Light is on,
why is no incense burning for this grave?
'Vương Quan told her this tale from first to last:
She was a famous singer once, Đạm Tiên,
Renowned for looks and talents in her day,
she lacked not lovers jostling at her door
But fate makes roses fragile in mid spring
off broke the flower that breathed forth heaven's scents
From overseas a stranger came to woo
and win a girl whose name spread far and wide
But when the lover's boat sailed into port,
he found the pin had snapped, the vase had crashed
A death still silence filled the void, her room;
all tracks of horse or wheels had blurred to moss
He wept, full of a grief no words could tell:
Harsh is the fate that has kept us apart!
Since in this life we are not meant to meet,
Jet me pledge you my troth for our next life
He purchased both a coffin and a hearse
and rested her in dust beneath this mound,
among the grass and flowers For many moons,
who's come to tend a grave that no one claims
A wall of pity lay within Kiéu s heart:
as soon as she had heard her tears burst forth
How sorrowful is women s lot! she cried
We all partake of woe, our common fate
Creator, why are you so mean and cruel,
blighting green days and fading rose fresh cheeks?
Alive, she played the wife to all the world,
alas, to end down there without a man!
Where are they now who shared in her embrace?
Where are they now who lusted for her charms?®
Since no one else gives her a glance, a thought,
Til light some incense candles while I'm here
Til mark our chance encounter on the road
perhaps, down by the Yellow Springs, she'll know
She prayed in mumbled tones, then she knelt down
to make a few low bows before the tomb
Dusk gathered on a patch of wilted weeds
reed tassels swayed as gently blew the breeze
She pulled a pin out of her hair and graved
four lines of stop short verse on a tree's bark
Deeper and deeper sank her soul in trance
all hushed, she tarried there and would not leave
The cloud on her fair face grew darker yet:
as sorrow ebbed or flowed, tears dropped or streamed
Vain said: My sister, you should be laughed at,
lavishing tears on one long dead and gone!
Since ages ont of mind, retorted Kiều,
harsh fate has cursed all women, sparing none
As I see her lie there, it hurts to think
what will become of me in later days
A fine speech you just made! protested Quan
It jars the ears to hear you speak of her
and mean yourself Dank air hangs heavy here
day's failing, and there s still a long way home
Kiều said: When one who shines in talent dies,
the body passes on, the soul remains
In her, perhaps, I've found a kindred heart
let's wait and soon enough she may appear
Before they could respond to what Kiều said,
a whirlwind rose from nowhere, raged and raved
It blustered, strewing buds and shaking trees
and scattering whiffs of perfume in the air
They strode along the path the whirlwind took
and plainly saw fresh footprints on the moss
They stared at one another, terror struck
You've heard the prayer of my pure faith! Kiều cried
As kindred hearts, we've joined each other here
transcending life and death, soul sisters meet
Dam Tiên had cared to manifest herself
to what she'd written Kiều now added thanks
A poet's feelings, rife with anguish, flowed:
she carved an old style poem on the tree
To leave or stay they all were wavering still
when nearby rang the sound of harness bells
They saw a youthful scholar come theit way
astride a colt he rode with slackened rein
He carried poems packing half his bag,
and tagging at his heels were some page boys
His frisky horse's coat was dyed with snow
His gown blent tints of grass and pale blue sky
He spied them from afar, at once alit
and walked toward them to pay them his respects
His figured slippers trod the green the field
now sparkled like some jade and ruby grove
Young Vuong stepped forth and greeted him he knew
while two shy maidens hid behind the flowers
He came from somewhere not so far away,
Kim Trọng, a scion of the noblest stock
Born into wealth and talent, he'd received
this wit from heaven, a scholar's trade from men
Manner and mien set him above the crowd:
he studied books indoors, lived high abroad
Since birth he'd always called this region home
he and young Vương were classmates at their school,
His neighbors fame had spread and reached his ear:
two beauties locked in their Bronze Sparrow Tower!
But, as if hills and streams had barred the way,
he had long sighed and dreamt of them, in vain
How lucky, in this season of new leaves,
to roam about and find his yearned for flowers!
He caught a fleeting glimpse of both afar:
spring orchid, autumn mum a gorgeous pair!
Beautiful girl and talented young man
what stirred their hearts their eyes still dared not say
They hovered, rapture bound, tween wake and dream:
they could not stay, nor would they soon depart,
The dusk of sunset prompted thoughts of gloom
he left, and longingly she watched him go
Below a stream flowed clear, and by the bridge
a twilit willow rustled threads of silk
When Kiều got back behind her flowered drapes,
the sun had set, the curfew gong had rung
Outside the window, squinting, peeped the moon
gold spilled on waves, trees shadowed all the yard
East drooped a red camellia, toward the next house:
as dewdrops fell, the spring branch bent and bowed
Alone, in silence, she beheld the moon,
her heart a raveled coil of hopes and fears:
Lower than that no person could be brought!
It's just a bauble then, the glittering life
And who is he? Why did we chance to meet?
Does fate intend some tie between us two?
Her bosom heaved in turmoil she poured forth
a wondrous lyric fraught with all she felt
The moonlight through the blinds was falling slant
Leaning against the window, she drowsed of,
Now out of nowhere there appeared a girl
of worldly glamour joined to virgin grace:
face washed with dewdrops, body clad in snow,
and hovering feet, two golden lotus blooms
With joy Kigu hailed the stranger, asking her:
Did you stray here from that Peach Blossom Spring?
We two are sister souls, the other said
Have you forgotten? We just met today!
My cold abode lies west of here, out there,
above a running brook, below a bridge
By pity moved, you stooped to notice me
and strew on me poetic pearls and gems
I showed them to our League Chief and was told '
your name is marked in the Book of the Damned
We both reap what we sowed in our past lives:
of the same League, we ride the selfsame boat
Well, ten new subjects our League Chief just set:
again please work your magie with a brush
Kigu did as asked and wrote with nymphic grace
her hand dashed off ten lyrics at one stroke,
Dam Tiên read them and marveled to herself:
Rich wrought embroidery from a heart of gold!
Included in the Book of Sorrow Songs,
they'll yield the palm to none but win first prize
The caller crossed the doorsill, turned to leave,
but Kigu would hold her back and talk some more
A sudden gust of wind disturbed the blinds,
and Kiều awakened, knowing she had dreamed
She looked, but nowhere could she see the girl,
though hints of perfume lingered here and there
Alone with her dilemma in deep night,
she viewed the road ahead and dread seized her
A rose afloat, a water fern adrift:
such was the lot her future held in store
Her inmost feelings surged, wave after wave:
again and yet again she broke and cried
Kiều s sobs sent echoes through the phoenix drapes
Aroused, her mother asked: What troubles you
that you stil stir and fret at dead of night,
your cheeks like some pear blossoms drenched with rain?
Kigu said: You once bore me, you've brought me up,
a double debt I've not repaid one whit
Today, while strolling, found Pam Tién s grave,
then in a dream she just revealed herself
She told me how by fate I'm doomed to grief,
delivered themes on which Ï wrote some songs
As I interpret what the dream portends,
my life in days ahead won't come to much!
Her mother said: Are dreams and vapors grounds
whereon to build a tale of woe? Just think!
Kigu tried to heed such words of sound advice,
but soon her tears welled up and flowed again
Outside the window chirped an oriole
over the wall a catkin flew next door
The tilting moonlight lay aslant the porch
she stayed alone, alone with her own grief,
How strange, the race of lovers! Try as you will,
you can t unsnarl their hearts entangled threads
Since Kim was back inside his book lined walls,
he could not drive her from his haunted mind,
He drained the cup of gloom: it filled anew
one day without her seemed three autumns long
Silk curtains veiled her windows like dense clouds,
and toward the rose within he'd dream his way
The moon kept waning, oil kept burning low:
his face yearned for her face, his heart her heart
The study room turned icy, metal cold
brushes lay dry, lute strings hung loose on frets
Hsiang bamboo blinds stirred rustling in the wind
incense roused longing, tea lacked love's sweet taste
If fate did not mean them to join as mates,
why had the temptress come and teased his eyes?
Forlorn, he missed the scene, he missed the girl:
he rushed back where by chance the two had met
A tract of land with grasses lush and green,
with waters crystal clear: he saw naught else
The breeze at twilight stirred a moad of grief
the reeds waved back and forth as if to taunt
A lover's mind is full of her he loves:
he walked straight on and made toward her Blue Bridge
Fast gate, high wall: no stream for his red leaf,
no passage for his bluebird bearing word
A willow dropped its curtain of silk threads
perched on a branch, an oriole chirped jeers
All doors were shut, all bolts were locked in place
A threshold strewn with flowers where was she?
He lingered, standing there as time passed by
then to the rear he strolled he saw a house,
Its owner, traveling heathen climes for trade,
was still away left vacant were the rooms
Young Kim, as student, came to rent the house
he brought his lute, his books, and settled in
He lacked for nothing trees and racks, a porch
inscribed in vivid gold: Kingfisher View '
The porch's name made him exult inside
Itmust be Heaven s will that we should meet!
He left his window open just a crack
and daily glanced his eyes toward that east wall
Nearby both spring and grotto stayed tight shut:
he failed to see the nymph flit in and out
Since he left home to dwell at this strange lodge,
twice on its rounds the moon had come and gone
Now, ona balmy day, across the wall,
he glimpsed a lissome form beneath peach trees
He dropped the lute, smoothed down his gown, rushed out:
her scent was wafting still of her no trace
As he paced round the wall, his eye espied
a golden hairpin caught on a peach branch
He reached for it and took it home He thought:
It left a woman's chamber and came here
This jewel must be hers Why, fate binds us
ifnot, could it have fallen in my hands?
Now sleepless, he admired and stroked the pin
still faintly redolent of sandalwood
At dawn when mists had cleared, he found the girl
peering along the wall with puzzled eyes
The student had been lurking there in wait
across the wall he spoke to test her heart:
From nowhere have found this hairpin here:
Iwould send back the pearl, but where's Ho
Now from the other side Kiều s voice was heard:
1 thank him who won t keep a jewel found
A pin's worth little, but it means so much
that in your scale what's right weighs more than gold
He said: We come and go in these same parts
we're neighbors, not two strangers, not at all!
Towe this moment to some scent you dropped
but countless torments I've endured till now
So long I've waited for just this one day!
Stay on and let me ask your private thoughts
He hurried off and fetched some things from home:
gold bracelets in a pair, a scarf of silk
By ladder he could climb across the wall:
she was the one he'd met that day, no doubt!
Ashamed, the girl maintained a shy reserve:
while he gazed at her face, she hung her head,
He said: We chanced to meet and ever since
Ihave in secret yearned and pined for you
My slender frame has wasted who'd have thought
that I could linger on to see this day?
For months I dreamt my goddess in the clouds;
lovelorn, I hugged my post, prepared to drown,
But you are here I beg to ask one thing
will on a leaf of grass the mirror shine?
She faltered after some demur she said:
Our ways are snow pure, plain as turnip greens
When comes the time for love, the marriage bond,
my parents wish will tie it or will not
You deign to care for me, but I'm too young
to know what's right and dare not give my word
He said: It blows one day and rains the next
how often does chance favor us in spring?
If you ignore and scorn my desperate love,
you'll hurt me yet what will it profit you?
Let's pledge our troth with something once that s done,
Till plan our wedding through a go between
Should Heaven disappoint my fondest hopes
Til throw away a life in vernal bloom
Iftoa lover's plea you shut your heart,
TÌI have pursued you all in vain, for naught!
All hushed, she drank in words whose music lulled
love stirred the autumn calm of her Fair eyes
She said: Although our friendship's still quite new,
how can my heart resist your heart's behest?
To your kind bosom you have taken me
Tiletch your word, our troth, in stone and bronze
Her words untied a knot within iis breast
to her he passed gold bracelets and red scarf
Henceforth °m bound to you for life he said
Call these small gifts a token of my love
In hand she had a sunflower figured fan:
she traded it that instant for her pin
They had just sworn an oath to seal their pact
when from the backyard voices came, abuzz
Both fled in flurries leaves and flowers fell,
and he regained his study, she her room
The stone and gold had touched and from that time,
their love grew deeper, more distraught their minds
The Hsiang, the stream of longing tears, ran low:
he waited at the spring, she at the mouth
The wall rose like a snow capped mountain range,
and words of love could not go back and forth
As windswept days and moonlit nights wheeled round,
red dimmed, green deepened spring was past and gone
A birthday feast fell due in Mother s clan:
with their two younger children, both old folks
in gay attire left home to journey forth
presenting their best wishes and a giết
A hushed, deserted house she stayed alone:
aa chance to see him on this day, she thought
She set out fare in season, treats galore,
then toward the wall she bent her nimble steps
She sent a soft voiced call across the flowers:
he was already there awaiting her
He said: Your heart cares not for what I feel
so long you've let love s fire burn to cold ash
Sorrow and yearning I have felt by turns,
and half my head of hair frost s tinged with gray
She said: Wind's held me up, rain s kept me back
T've hurt your feelings much against my wish
Tm home alone today I've come out here
to make amends repaying love for love
She slid around the rock garden and reached
a fresh barred passage at the walls far end
She rolled up sleeves, unlocked the fairy cave,
and cleared through clouds the path to Paradise!
Face gazed at face to glow with purest joy
Fond greetings they exchanged Then, side by side,
they walked together toward his study room
while mingling words of love and vows of troth
Brush rack and tube for poems on his desk
above, there hung a sketch of pale green pines
Frost bitten and wind battered, they looked real:
the more she gazed, the more they sprang to life
It's something I dashed off just now, he said
Please write your comments, lending it some worth
Her nymphic hand moved like a lashing storm
and penned some quatrains right atop the pines
Your magic conjures gems and pearls! he cried
Could Pan and Hsieh have measured up to this?
If I did not earn merit in past lives,
ould I be blessed with you, my treasure, now?
She said: I've dared to peek and read your face:
you shall wear jade or cross the Golden Gate
But | deem my own lot a mayfiy s wing:
will Heaven square things out and round things off ?
Back in my childish years, I still recall,
a seer observed my features he foretold:
All charms and splendors from within burst forth
she'll live an artists life, a life of woe
Hook at you, then on myself look back:
how could good luck, ill huck conjoin and thrive?
He said: That we have met means fate binds us
Man's will has often vanquished Heaven's whim
But should the knot which ties us fall apart,
Tl keep my troth and sacrifice my life
They bared and shared all secrets of their souls
spring feelings quivered hearts, spring wine turned heads
A happy day is shorter than a span:
the western hills had swallowed up the sun
With none at home, she could no longer stay
she left him, rushing back to her own room,
News of her folks she learned when she reached home:
her feasting parents would not soon be back
She dropped silk curtains at the entrance door,
then crossed the garden in dark night, alone
The moon through branches cast shapes bright or dark
through curtains glimmered flickers of a lamp
The student at his desk had nodded of,
reclining half awake and half asleep
The girl's soft footsteps woke him from his drowse:
the moon was setting as she hovered near
He wondered was this Wu hsia the fairy hill,
where he was dreaming now a spring night's dream?
Alonga lonesome, darkened path, she said,
for love of you I found my way to you
Now we stand face to face but who can tell
we shan t wake up and learn it was a dream?
He bowed and welcomed her, then he replaced
the candle and refilled the incense urn
Both wrote a pledge of troth, and with a knife
they cut in two a lock of her long hair
The stark bright moon was gazing from the skies
as with one voice both mouths pronounced the oath
Their hearts recesses they explored and probed,
etching their vow of union in their bones
Both sipped a nectar wine from cups of jade
silks breathed their scents, the mirror glassed their selves
The breeze blows cool, the moon shines clear, he said,
but in my heart still burns a thirst unquenched
The pestle s yet to pound on the Blue Bridge
fear my bold request might give offense
She said: By the red leaf, the crimson thread,
we're bound for life our oath proves mutual faith
Of love make not a sport, a dalliance,
and what would I begrudge you otherwise?
He said: You've won wide fame as lutanist
like Chung Tzu ch i I've longed to hear you play
I's no great art, my luting, answered she,
but if you so command, Ï must submit
In the back porch there hung his moon shaped lute
he hastened to present it in both hands,
at eyebrow s height My petty skill, she cried,
ig causing you more bother than it s worth!
By turns she touched the strings, both high and low,
to tune all four to five tones, then she played
Anair, The Battlefield of Han and Chu,
made one hear bronze and iron clash and clang
The Ssu ma tune, 4 Phoenix Seeks His Mate,
sounded so sad, the moan of grief itself
Here was Chi K ang's famed masterpiece, Kuang ling
\was it a stream that flowed, a cloud that roamed?
Crossing the Border gate here was Chao chiin,
half lonesome for her lord, half sick for home
Clear notes like cries of egrets flying past;
dark tones like torrents tumbling in mid course
Andantes languid as a wafting breeze;
allegros rushing like a pouring rain
The lamp now flared, now dimmed and there he sat
hovering between sheer rapture and deep gloom
He'd hug his knees or he'd hang down his head
he'd feel his entrails wrenching, knit his brows
Indeed, a master s touch, he said at last,
but it betrays such bitterness within!
Why do you choose to play those plaintive strains
which grieve your heart and sorrow other souls?
T'm settled in my nature, she replied
Who knows why Heaven makes one sad or gay?
Bat | shall mark your golden words, their truth,
and by degrees my ternper may yet mend
A fragrant rose, she sparkled in full bloom,
bemused his eyes, and kindled his desire
When waves of lust had seemed to sweep him off,
his wooing turned to wanton liberties
She said: Treat not our love as just a game
please stay away from me and let me speak
What is a mere peach blossom that one should
fence off the garden, thwart the blucbird s quest?
Bat you've named me your bride to serve her man,
she must place chastity above all else,
They play in mulberry groves along the P'u,
but who would care for wenches of that ilk?
Are we to snatch the moment, pluck the fruit,
and in one sole day wreck a lifelong trust?
Let's ponder those love stories old and new
what well matched pair could equal Tỷ ui and Chang?
Yet passion's storms did topple stone and bronze:
she cloyed her lover humoring all his whims
As wing to wing and limb tơ limb they lay,
contempt already lurked beside their hearts
Under the western roof the two burned out
the incense of their vow, and love turned shame
If I don't cast the shuttle in defense,
vwe'll ater blush for it who'll bear the guilt?
Why force your wish on your shy flower so soon ?
While I'm alive, you'll sometime get your due
The voice of sober reason gained his ear,
and tenfold his regard for her increased,
As silver paled along the eaves, they heard
an urgent call from outside his front gate
She ran back toward her chamber while young Kim
rushed out and crossed the yard where peaches bloomed
The brushwood gate unbolted, there came in
a houseboy with a missive fresh from home
Itsaid Kim s uncle while abroad had died,
whose poor remains were now t0 be brought back
To far Liao yang, beyond the hills and streams,
he'd go and lead the cortege, Father bade
What he'd just learned astounded Kim at once
he hurried to her house and broke the news
In full detail he told her how a death,
striking his clan, would send him far away
We've scarcely seen each other now we part
We've had no chance to tie the mariage tie
But it's still there, the moon that we swore by
not face to face, we shall stay heart to heart
Acday will last three winters far from you:
my tangled knot of grief won't soon unknit
Care for yourself, my gold, my jade, that I,
at the world s ends, may know some peace of mind
She heard him speak, her feelings in a snari
With broken words, she uttered what she thought:
Why does he hate us so who spins silk threads?
Before we've joined in joy we part in grief,
Together we did swear a sacred oath:
my hair shall gray and wither, not my love
What matter if | must wait months and years?
Til think of my wayfaring man and grieve
We've pledged to wed our hearts T'll never leave
and play my lute aboard another's boat
As long as hills and streams endure, come back,
remembering her who is with you today
They lingered hand in hand and could not part,
bút now the sun stood plumb above the roof
Step by slow step he tore himself away
at each farewell their tears would fall in streams
Horse saddled and bags tied in haste, he left
they split their grief in half and parted ways
Strange landscapes met his mournful eyes on trees
cuckoos galore, at heaven's edge some geese,
Grieve for him who must bear through wind and rain
aheart more loaded down with love each day
There she remained, her back against the porch,
her feelings snarled like raveled skeins of silk
Through window bars she gazed at mists beyond
a washed out rose, a willow gaunt and pale
Distraught, she tarried walking back and forth
when from the birthday feast her folks returned
Before they could trade news of health and such,
in burst a mob of bailiffs on all sides
With cudgels under arm and swords in hand,
those fiends and monsters rushed around, berserk
They cangued them both, the old man, his young son
one cruel rope trussed two dear beings up
Then, like bluebottles buzzing through the house,
they smashed workbaskets, shattered looms to bits
They grabbed all jewels, fineries, personal things,
scooping the household clean to fill greed s bag
From nowhere woe had struck who'd caused it all?
Who'd somehow set the snare and sprung the trap?
Upon inquiry it was later learned
some knave who sold raw silk had brought a charge
Fear gripped the household cries of innocence
shook up the earth injustice dimmed the clouds
All day they groveled, begged, and prayed deaf ears
would hear no plea, harsh hands would spare no blow
A rope hung each from girders, by his heels
rocks would have broken, let alone mere men
Their faces spoke sheer pain and fright this wrong
could they appeal to Heaven far away?
Lawmen behaved that day as is their wont,
wreaking dire havoc just for money's sake
By what means could she save her flesh and blood?
When evil strikes, you bow to circumstance
As you must weigh and choose between your love
and filial duty, which will turn the scale?
She put aside all vows of love and troth
a child first pays the debts of birth and care
Resolved on what to do, she said: Hands off
THỊ sell myself and Father I'l redeem
There was an elderly scrivener surnamed Chung,
a bureaucrat who somehow had a heart
He witnessed how a daughter proved her love
and felt some secret pity for her plight
Planning to pave this way and clear that path,
he reckoned they would need three hundred liang,
He'd have her kinsmen freed for now, bade her
provide the sum within two days or three
Pity the child, so young and so naive
misfortune, like a storm, swooped down on her
To part from Kim meant sorrow, death in life
would she still care for life, much less for Love?
A raindrop does not brood on its poor fate;
a leaf of grass repays three months of spring
Matchmakers were advised of her intent
brisk rumor spread the tidings near and far
There lived a woman in that neighborhood,
who brought a suitor, one from out of town,
When asked, he gave his name as Scholar Ma
and claimed his home to be Lin ch ing, near here
Past forty, far beyond the bloom of youth,
he wore a smooth shaved face and smart attire
Master and men behind came bustling in
the marriage broker ushered him upstairs
He grabbed the best of seats and sat in state
while went the broker bidding Kiều come out
Crushed by her kinsfolk's woe and her own grief,
she crossed the sill, tears flowing at each step
She felt the chill of winds and dews, ashamed
to look at flowers or see her mirrored face
The broker smoothed her hair and stroked her hand,
coaxing a wilted mum, a gaunt plum branch
He pondered looks, gauged skills he made her play
the moon shaped lute, write verses on a fan
Of her lush charms he relished each and all:
well pleased, he set to bargaining a deal
He said: For jade I've come to this Blue Bridge
tell me how much the bridal gift will cost
The broker said: She's worth her weight in gold!
But im distress they'll look to your big heart
They haggled hard and long, then struck a deal:
the price for her, four hundred and some liang
All was smooth paddling once they gave their word
as pledges they swapped horoscopic cards
and set the day when, full paid for, she'd wed
When cash is ready, what cannot be fixed?
Old Chung was asked to help at his request,
old Vương could on probation go back home
Pity the father facing his young child
Looking at her, he bled and died within:
You raise a daughter wishing she might find
a fitting match, might wed a worthy mate
O Heaven, why inflict such woes on us?
Who slandered us to tear our home apart?
1 would not mind the ax for these old bones,
but how can I endure my child's ordeal?
Death now of later happens only once
I'd rather pass away than suffer so
After he'd said those words he shed more tears
and made to knock his head against a wall
They rushed to stop him, then she softly spoke
and with some words of comfort calmed him down:
What is she worth, a stripting of a girl
who's not repaid one whit a daughter's debts?
Ying once shamed me, petitioning the throne
could T fall short of Li who sold herself2
Asit grows old, the cedar is a tree
that singly shoulders up so many boughs
If moved by love you won't let go of me,
fear a storm will blow and blast our home
You'd better sacrifice just me one flower
will turn to shreds, but green will stay the leaves,
Whatever lot befalls me T accept
think me a blossom nipped when budding green
Let no wild notions run around your head
or you shall wreck our home and hurt yourself
Words of good sense sank smoothly in his ear
they stared at one another, pouring tears
Outside, that Scholar Ma appeared again
they signed the contract, silver then changed hands
A wanton god, the Old Man of the Moon
at random tying couples with his threads!
When money s held in hand it's no great trick
swaying men s hearts and turning black to white
Old Chung did all he could and gave all help:
gifts once presented, charges were dismissed
Her family's woes were settled for a time,
but now the bridal hour drew on apace
Alone, she huddled by the midnight lamp,
with tear soaked gown and sorrow withered hair:
No matter what fate deals me, I will grieve
for him who's steadfast kept the vow he swore
How much he toiled and strove to win my love!
But grown attached to me, he s marred his life
The cup we both drank from has barely dried
when I now break my oath and play him false
In far away Liao yang how can he guess
our union's torn asunder by my hand?
So many vows of love we traded once!
Oh, what will they amount to in this life?
But haunted by troth incense we once burned,
Ti be reborn a beast and make amends
Till I've paid off my debt of love to him,
my heart will stay a crystal down below
Her secret thoughts kept spinning round and round
as lamp oil burned away, tears drenched her scarf
Thúy Vân, who just awoke from some sweet dream,
stopped by the lamp and with concern inquired:
In Heaven's complex scheme of flux and change,
you're left to bear the family s woes alone
Is that why you've stayed up the livelong night?
Or with some secret are you still beset?
Kiều said: My heart s near bursting, for it s caught
in love's own webs and tangles yet unsnarled,
feel ashamed to part my lips and tell,
but if I hid it I would wrong his love
Should you agree I'll ask you Please sit down
and let me bow to you before I speak
Midway my bonds of love with him have snapped
let me trust you to mend and splice what's left
Since | met Kim 1 gave my fan in pledge
we drank of the same cup and swore our troth
Then out of nowhere broke a storm on us
how could both love and duty be fulfilled?
You have long days of spring ahead please heed
the call of blood, redeem my pledge for me
Though flesh and bones will then have turned to dust,
Tl breathe your happiness and smile down there
Bracelets and pledge on paper decked with clouds:
preserve this troth, these things are jointly ours,
When bound as man and wife, you two will mourn
a star crossed girl and nurse her in your hearts
I shall have vanished leaving few remains:
a lute, troth incense burned in days gone by
Sometime, if ever you will tune this lute
or light that incense vessel, look outdoors:
among the grass and leaves you'll see a breeze
waft back and forth you'll know that I've come home
My soul, still haunted by the oath, will try
to keep my pledge though I'l have turned to naught
The world of night will hide my face, my voice
yet, please shed tears for someone wronged by fate
Ah, now the pin has snapped, the vase has crashed:
past all expression, how I cherish him!
Through you I'll send my humblest bows to hit:
the tie of love between us is cụt short
Why have I drawn a lot as gray as dirt?
The flower's doomed to drift along the stream,
O Kim, my dearest Kim! This is the end:
as of today I'll have betrayed your trust
That said, her blood went wild, her spirit swooned:
all breath fell hushed, both hands grew cold as ice
The parents rose at once from their deep steep
the household was astir inside and out
They bustled fetching some tisane, some drug:
she wakened from her faint, still wet with tears
They asked her why so strangely she behaved
Kiều sobbed and sobbed but could not speak one word
Van told her secret whispering in the ear:
These are the bracelets, here's the written pledge
Your father, I caused you to break your troth!
But may your sister honor it in your stead
Whose fault is it that lovers now must part,
that now our child must lead a wanderer s life?
As to your wish, though stone may crumble down,
my word will stand I shall not fail your trust
Before him she bowed low and softly said:
Father, help me fulfill my pledge to him
then I shan1 mind a slave's own lot or care
if T should leave my bones in alien soil
How to express her grief while on the tower
watchman tolled and tolled the hours of night?
A carriage, flower decked, arrived outside
with flutes and lutes to bid dear kin part ways
She grieved to go, they grieved to stay behind:
tears soaked stone steps as parting tugged their hearts
Across a twilit sky dragged sullen clouds
grasses and branches drooped, all drenched with dew
He led her to an inn and left her there
within four walls, a maiden in her spring
The girl felt torn between dire dread and shame
she'd sadly brood, her heart would ache and ache
A rose divine lay fallen in vile hands,
once kept from sun or rain for someone's sake:
Ifonly Thad known I'd sink so low,
| should have let my true love pluck my bud
Because I fenced it well from the east wind,
I failed him then and make him suffer now
When we're to meet again, what will be left
of my poor body here to give much hope?
If | indeed was born to float and drift,
how can a woman live with such a fate?
Upon the table lay a knife at hand
she grabbed it, hid it wrapped inside her scart:
Yes, if and when the flood should reach my feet,
this knife may later help decide my life
The autumn night wore on, hour after hour
alone, she mused, half wakeful, half asleep
She did not know that Scholar Mã, the rogue,
had always patronized the haunts of lust
The rake had hit a run of blackest luck
in whoredom our whoremaster sought his bread
Now, in a brothel, languished one Dame Tú
whose wealth of charms was taxed by creeping age
Mere hazard, undesigned, can bring things off:
sawdust and bitter melon met and merged
They pooled resources, opening a shop
to sell their painted dolls all through the year
Country and town they scoured for concubines
whom they would teach the trade of play and love
With Heaven lies your fortune, good or ill,
and woe will pick you if youre marked for woe
Pity a small, frail bit of womankind,
a flower sold to board a peddler s boat
She now was caught in all his bag of tricks
a paltry bridal gift, some slapdash rites
He crowed within: The flag has come to hand!
I view rare jade it stirs my heart of gold!
The kingdom's queen of beauty! Heaven's scent!
One smile of hers is worth pure gold it's true,
When she gets there, to pluck the maiden bud,
princes and gentlefolk will push and shove
She'll bring at least three hundred liang, about
what I have paid net profit after that
A morsel dangles at my mouth what God
serves up I crave, yet money hate to lose
À heavenly peach within a mortal's grasp:
Til bend the branch, pick it, and quench my thirst
How many flower fanciers on earth
can really tell one flower from the next?
Juice from pomegranate skin and cockscomb blood
will heal it up and lend the virgin look
In dim half light some yokel will be fooled:
she'll fetch that much, and not one penny less
If my old broad finds out and makes a scene,
Tltake it like a man, down on my knees!
Besides, it's still a long, long way from home:
if don t touch her, later she'll suspect
Oh, shame! A pure camellia had to let
the bee explore and probe all ins and outs
Astorm of lust broke forth it would not spare
the flawless jade, respect the pristine scent
All this spring night was one bad dream she woke
to lie alone beneath the nuptial torch
Her tears of silent grief poured down like rain
she hated him, she loathed herself as much:
What breed is he, a creature foul and vile?
My body's now a blot on womanhood
What hope is left to cherish after this?
A life that s come to this is life no more
By turns she cursed her fate, she moaned her lot
She grabbed the knife and thought to kill herself
She mulled it over: IE I were alone,
it wouldn't matter T've two loved ones, though
If trouble should develop afterwards,
an inquest might ensue and work their doom
Perhaps my plight will ease with passing time,
Sooner or later, I'm to die just once
While she kept tossing reasons back and forth, 4
a rooster shrilly crowed outside the wall
The watchtower horn soon blared through morning mists,
so Mà gave orders, making haste to leave
Oh, how it rends the heart, the parting hour,
when horse begins to trot and wheels to jolt! 5
Ten miles beyond the city, at a post,
the father gave a feast to bid farewell
While host and guests were making cheer outside,
mother and Kiều were huddling now indoors
As they gazed at each other through hot tears, §
Kiều whispered all her doubts in mother s ear:
m just a girl, so helpless, to my shame
| when could | ever pay a daughter's debts?
Lost here where water s mud and dust s soil free
Tilleave with you my heart from now, for life 8
To judge by what I've noticed these past days,
Tfear a scoundrel s hands are holding me
When we got there, he left me all alone
He tarried coming in, but out he dashed
He halts and stammers often when he talks 8
His men make light of him, treat him with scorn
He lacks the ease and grace of gentlefolk,
seeming just like some merchant on close watch
What else to say? Your daughter's doomed to live
on foreign land and sleep in alien soil
Atall those words, Dame Vương let out a shriek
that would pierce heaven, crying for redress
Before they had drunk dry the parting cup,
Mã rushed outside and urged the coach to leave
Mourning his daughter in his heavy heart,
old Vương stood by the saddle begging M:
Because fate struck her family this frail girl
is now reduced to serving you as slave
Henceforth, beyond the sea, at heaven's edge,
she'll live lone days with strangers, rain or shine ,
On you, her lofty oak, she will depend,
a vine you'll shelter from cold frosts and snows
'Whereat the bridegroom said: ''Our feet are bound
by that mysterious thread of crimson silk
The sun's my witness if I should break faith,
may all the demons strike me with their swords!
By stormwinds hurtled under rolling clouds,
the coach roared off in swirls of ocher dust
Wiping their tears, they followed with their eyes:
on that horizon, day and night, they'd gaze
She traveled far, far into the unknown,
Bridges stark white with frost, woods dark with clouds
Reeds huddling close while blew the cold north wind
an autumn sky for her and her alone
A road that stretched far off in hushed, still night
she saw the moon, felt shame at her love vows,
Fall woods green tiers all interlaid with red:
bird cries reminded her of her old folks
She crossed unheard of streams, climbed nameless hills
the moon waxed full again: Lin tzu was reached
The carriage stopped before an entrance gate
a woman, parting curtains, stalked right out
One noticed at first glance her pallid skin
what did she feed upon to gain such bulk?
With wanton cheer she met them by the coach
Kiều, at her bidding, meekly stepped indoors
On one side, there sat girls with penciled brows,
and on the other four or five gay blades,
Between, an altar all rigged out: above,
the image of that god with hoary brows
In bawdyhouses old tradition bids
them worship him as patron of their trade,
offer him flowers, burn incense day and night
When some jinxed gal drew too few customers,
in front of him she'd doff her shirt and skirt,
then light some incense candies mumbling prayer
She'd take all faded flowers ta line her mat,
and bees would swarm a buzzing all around!
Bewildered, unaware of what it was,
Kiều just knelt down as told the bawd then prayed:
May fortune bless this house and business thrive
n nights of mirth, on days of revelry!
lay all men fall in love with her and come
locking like orioles and swallow birdst
t billets dotux and messages pour in!
Let clients throng both doorways, front and back!
strange sounds that made no sense to Kiéu's stunned ears,
jand that whole scene struck her as all amiss
Once she'd paid homage to her houschold god,
Dame Tú installed herself upon a couch
She ordered: Kmeel and bow before your aunt,
then go and kowtow to your uncle there
By fortune banished from my home, said Kiều,
Thugged my humble lot as concubine
A swallow s somehow turned an oriole:
what's my real status I'm too young to know
With bridal presents, wedding rites, and all,
wwe did share bed and board, as man and wife
But now it seems the roles and ranks have changed:
Í may | beg you to make it clear for me?
The woman heard the tale and learned the truth
her devils, fiends, and demons all broke loose:
What happened is as plain as day to see!
She caught my man alive for her own use!
1 sent him for some lass to bring back here
and put to work as hostess, earn our bread
But that false hearted knave, that beastly rogue
had his damn itch he played and messed with her
Now that the cloth has lost all starch and glaze,
there goes to hell the money I put up!
You litte strumpet, they sold you to me,
and in my house you go by my house rules
When that old lecher tried his dirty trick,
why did you listen? Slap his face, instead!
Why did you just lie there and take it all?
The merest chit, do you already rut?
1 must teach you how I lay down the law
She grabbed a whip, about to pounce and lash
Heaven and earth bear witness! Kiều cried out
My life I threw away when I left home
What now remains of it to have and hold?
At once she pulled the knife out of her sleeve
O horror, she found heart to kill herself! ,
The bawd stood watching, helpless, as Kiều stabbed,
Alas, were all such perfect gifts and charms
to leave this earth, dissevered by a knife?
The girl's misfortune soon got noised abroad
a crowd came pouring in and packed the house
While she was lying there in slumber s lap,
the bawd just stared and shook, her wits scared off
Then Kiều was carried out to the west porch
someone nursed her, a doctor was called in
Her ties to earth were not yet sundered, though
asleep, Kiều sensed a girl was standing by
And whispered she: Your karma s still undone:
how could you shirk your debt of grief to life?
You're still to bear the fortune of a rose:
you wish to quit, but Heaven won't allow
Live and fulfill your destiny, frail reed:
ơn the Ch'ien t ang we two shall meet again
With balms and salves applied all through the day,
Kiều slowly wakened from her deathlike swoon
Dame Trủ was waiting by the patient's bed
to coax her into line with chosen words:
How many lives can anybody claim?
You are a rosebud spring has scarcely sprung,
Something has gone awry how could I force
your sterling virtue into games of love?
But since you've strayed and ended here, lock up
your chamber waiting for your nuptial day
While you still have your body you have all
you'll make a perfect match with some young heir,
Why visit havoc on a blameless head?
Why lose your life and hurt me? What's the good?
The earnest plea she murmured in Kiều s ear
sounded like logic, sorting right from wrong,
Besides, there was the message of her dream:
in human fortune Heaven takes a hand
If she died now and left her debt unpaid,
she'd pay with interest in some future life
She listened, thinking hard from first to last,
then said: Who would have all this come to pass?
If you make good your word, I'll thank my luck
But will tomorrow's deed match what's pledged now?
1 dread to deal with bees and butterflies
Td sooner die unsoiled than live in mud
The madam said: My daughter, ease your mind
How could I have the heart to humbug you?
TẾ later I renege, there sits my judge,
the sun that shines on us from overhead
An oath so solemn set Kigu s heart at rest
little by little all her fears were calmed
Locked in her spring at Crystal Tower, she lived
with friends some hills far off, the moon near by
On all four sides her ranging eyes could see
the gold of dunes, the ocher dust of trails
With shame she watched dawn clouds, the midnight lamp
the scene and what she felt both filled her soul
He'd shared the cup with her beneath the moon
now, day by day, he longed for news of her
Stranded and waifed upon a distant shore,
when could she ever cleanse her heart of love?
She grieved for those awaiting at the door:
who fanned them now when hot, warmed them when cold?
After these months, the yard s catalpa tree
must be a size to stretch her arms around
She sadly watched the harbor in gray dusk
whose boat was that with fluttering sails, far off?
She sadly watched the river flow to sea
where would this flower end, adrift and lost?
She sadly watched the field of wilted grass,
the bluish haze where merged the earth and clouds
She sadly watched the wind whip up the cove
and set all waves a roaring round her seat
Hemmed in by foreign streams and alien hills,
the exile cried her grief in sad quatrains
Dully, she dropped the curtain, then she heard
a voice across the wall reply her poems
He was a stranger in the flush of youth,
with polished image, elegant cap and robe
She thought him one brought up among fine books
when she inquired, she learned he was Sở K hanh,
He'd glimpsed the charmer hid behind the shade
and seemed heart smitten he declared his love:
Alas, a beauty fit for kings and gods!
By what queer twist of fate did she stray here?
She ought to rule the moon, among the clouds
how could a rose be doomed to this vile life?
My bosom boils at Heaven, that old scamp,
but can she guess your feelings, O my heart?
Tronly she could know, here is the man
| who'll free her from her cage it's mere child s play
The auturnn window shut tight once again,
is sonorous words still echoed in her ears,
> She thought of him, and then thought of herself:
his pity touched her she felt less a waif
Day followed day, so humdrum, rain or shine
when could she ever leave this dust gray life?
She'd take a chance, send word and beg the man
to pluck her from the sea of all her woes
Aletter told her tale: how she had paid
a daughter's debts and by ill luck strayed here
Asdawn broke through the morning mists and glowed,
she had a messenger deliver it
The gold lit sky was blurring in the west,
when from the man a prompt reply arrived
She opened his fine paper note and read:
two characters, li yeh, in clear cut strokes
She tried to penetrate their hidden sense:
The twenty first, hour of the dog, perhaps
Through dusk birds shuttled flying home to woods
over camellias peeped just half a moon
Branches stirred shadows on the eastern wall:
parting the shutters, lo, Sở Khanh crept in
Abashed, she rallied heart to weleome hìm
on bended knees, she whispered her appeal:
A water fern, a bubble that s my fate,
T've strayed to fall among these birds of mirth
May I beg you to give me back my life?
For you I shall knot grass and fetch jade rings
He listened, nodding, grinning to himself,
then said: I m not just anybody, mind!
Since you trust me and turn to me for help,
Til drain it, fill it in, your sea of woes!
I'll rest on you for everything, she
Decide adopt whatever plan you will
He said: I have some horses fleet as winds,
and in my service quite a brawny chap
Let's grasp our opportunity, slip away!
Can any scheme on earth surpass swift ight?
If something should by any chance go wrong,
itwill not matter for I shall be there
Her worst suspicions quickened at this speech
but gone too far, she could not now draw back
She shut her eyes and headlong flung herself
to see how far the Maker would roll her
Together they stole down the stairs and left
each on a horse, the girl behind the man
The auturnn night was waning Wind lashed trees
spilt leaves; the woods had swallowed up the moon
Grass wanly gleamed with dew along the trail
as step by step she went, she yearned for home
In throaty chorus cocks were crowing dawn
when from the rear she heard a hue and cry
Her heart began to thump inside her breast
| Sở Khanh had quick turned rein and somewhere fled
She knew not what to do, left all alone
to jolt her way in terror through the woods
0 Heaven, wanton knave, how could your heart
let you thus crush and trample down a rose?
A gang closed in on her she had no claws
to burrow and escape, no wings to fly
Dame Tú arrived in hot haste on the scene
and swept her up to drag her home forthwith
The madam asked no questions wild with rage,
she thrashed the flower, flailed the willow tree
All human beings are but flesh and blood
what rose, when torn and shattered, feels no pain?
Kiều spared no words she pleaded, she confessed,
bowing her mangled back, her bloodied head
She said: This litle woman left her home
to trek through hills and streams and founder here
Now in your hands you hold my life or death
Brought to this pass, my person's reached an end
What care I for myself? My fate is set
But your investment would you really risk?
How can an ee! mind muddying its head?
Hereafter TÌI forget my maiden shame
The bawd seized on Kiéu s promise she required
a guarantor, a pledge in black and white
Among the housemates was a girl, Mã Kigu,
who pitied her and dared to vouch for her
The bawd kept grilling her and flaying her
till she had spent her fury, then she quit
They carried Kiều indoors to nurse her wounds
Ma Kiều spoke out her mind and gave advice:
You did fall prey to him, an arrant scamp
who ever hasn't heard of that Sở Khanh?
It's asa brothel cad he s made his name
his hand has plucked and buried many flowers
Both planned and played that feint, the sword in fight,
for bawd and pimp connived, as thick as thieves
Some thirty liang had passed from her to him
iff not, would he have put that comedy on?
Now that the deed is done, he'll turn about:
don t you provoke him or you'll lose your life
But he did swear those sacred oaths! Kiều said
How can he prove a man of such deceit?
Kigu was still brooding over this or that
when he came ushering in his brazen face
Sở Khanh harangued for all the world to hear:
They say a wench, newcomer in this house,
has claimed I tempted her, led her astray
Let her face me, see who I really am
She answered hìm: Let's not discuss it, then
You say it didn t happen so it did not!
Sở Khanh cursed her, damned her in thundering tones,
Si Came nt let with fats All ringed te eke
) Heaven, she exclaimed, you do know who
2ught this to pass, seducing me, poor girl!
led me on, then pushed me down the pit
swore to me, then broke his oath at once
y hand still holds his note, which says hsi vii
at face was his own face whose else was it?
Her forthright words were heard by one and all:
y scorned his perfidy, his heartless scheme
¢ lover's breach of faith was plain to see:
tmefaced, the rascal beat a quick retreat,
Alone in her own room, she sobbed and wept
›oding upon herself, she mourned her lot:
pity! A thing frost pure and silver white
st rol] in dust and storm, like all the rest
L grief or joy, it s just one human Fate:
| mere rose to last forevermore?
cause I badly lived an earlier life,
v in this world I must redeem past sins
'innocence is lost a broken vase:
body shall pay off my debts to life
The mirror of the moon was shining bright
me Tú sat down by Kiều and lectured her
he trade of love, my girl, takes care and pains,
| we who ply it must know all its tricks
am the toy of winds and storms, Kigu said
I must give my body, so be it!
The bawd continued: Men are all alike:
y'l get their money's worth or won't come here
sre are more things to love than meet the eye
| ways to cope with men by day or dark
ow these by heart learn seven ploys to catch
thold a man, eight ways to please in bed
y love with them until you've played them out,
heads must swim, till hearts of stone must spin
w flirt with eyebrows, now coquet with lips
w sing the moon, now sport among the flowers
you have it, our house s stock in trade:
1 itand be a mistress of our craft!
From first to last Kiều listened, learning
her eyebrows pursed, her face turned deadly pale
She felt such shame just hearing what was taught
What ironies the tides of life throw up! 1
A girl, wellborn and raised in her good home,
now bound a prentice to this curious trade
How fast a face will harden, tanned by shame!
Can human life sink lower than her plight?
Alas for her, one gone astray and lost:
what could she do, held in a stranger s clutch?
Down came her curtains in the house of mirth:
high priced, her jade was all the more desired,
Around the rose swarmed bees and butterflies
for nights of merriment, for months of spree 1
Birds flocked the branch, winds stirred the leaves she'd speed
some beau at dawn, wait for some spark at dusk
When, late at night, wine fumes had all cleared off,
she'd start from sleep to sorrow for herself,
Brocade had wrapped her, silk had sheltered her
now torn to shreds, the rose lay by the road
Poor callous face the wind and dew had tanned
Poor body bees and butterflies gorged on
Over her flesh let them all rage and storm
did she herself feel what they would call love? 1
| She'd hug a breeze or flowers, she'd watch snow
half hide the shades or moonlight spread around
But her own gloom would tinge each sight or scene:
when you feel grief, can what you see give joy?
She'd write some verse or paint, she'd pluck the lute )
by moonlight or play chess beneath the flowers
But such delights she feigned and did not feel:
who can you love when no one knows your heart?
Wind in bamboos, rain on plum trees she ignored:
a hundred cares beset a single soul
Her heart, evoking things long past or fresh,
became a raveled skein, a mass of sores
She missed the two she owed nine debts, whose sun
was sinking day by day toward mulberry trees
Beyond the deep sunk streams and far flung hills,
how could they guess what had become of her?
Of sophoras their yard had two, still young:
who now could take her place and tend their needs?
And she recalled her vow of deathless troth:
far, far away, did he know of her plight?
When he came home for her, the willow branch
had been snatched off and passed from hand to hand
She hoped his love could somehow be repaid:
was now the flower grafted on the bough?
All her emotions tangled like sleave silk
as dreams of home kept stirring sleep till dawn,
From her gauze curtained window, at heaven's edge,
alone, forlorn, she'd watch dusk follow dusk
While the moon hare and the sun crow whirled round,
she mourned all victims in the Sortow League
They're given all the splendor of a rose,
but they must pay for it in coin of grief
Doomed to a life of dust and storm, they'll drink
their cup of shame and odium to the dregs
Now, asa brothel patron, came a man:
Kỷ Tâm of the Thúc clan, a well read breed
He'd followed Father leaving Hai in Ch'ang
to open at Lin tzu a trading shop
Kiều s fame as queen of beauty had reached him
he called and left his card in her boudoir
Behind the tasseled drapes he faced the flower:
his fancy relished each of all her charms
The young camellia, shimmering on its stern,
would glow still brighter with each fresh spring shower!
Man and girl, girl and man in fevered clasp:
on a spring night, how can one quell the heart?
Of course, when two kin spirits meet, one Lie
soon binds them in a knot none can yank Joose
They'd tryst and cling together night or day
What had begun as lust soon turned to love
It chanced that, by a stroke of timely luck,
his father went away to journey home
And more bewitched than ever, our young man
would often see his darling these spring days
tOn wind swept balconies, in moon washed yards,
they'd sip rare liquor, improvise linked verse
With incense burned at dawn, with tea at noon,
they'd play chess games, perform duets on lutes
One dizzy round of pleasures caught them both
they knew each other's moods, grew more attached,
A woman's charms, O wondrous tidal waves
that tumble homes and topple halls like toys!
Young Thúc, who squandered money with both hands,
could spend his all on one seductive smile
The bawd would sleek Kigu s hair, would paint her faee
the stench of coins excites the blood with greed
For summer cuckoos cried beneath the moon:
above the wall pomegranates kindled fire
Now, in her chamber, at a leisured hour,
she dropped the curtain for an orchid bath
Lo, such pure jade and such white ivory!
Her body stood as Heaven's masterwork
He gazed and gazed transported with delight,
he sang his love and penned a T ang poem
Tim glad to know your sentiments, she said
Each word is pearl or jade, each line brocade
Clever or not, I owe you my reply
homesickness, though, gives thoughts that hold me back
My heart still dwells beneath those golden clouds
No answer will your poem get today
You're talking in the strangest way, he said
But are you not an offshoot from her stock?
More gloom now dimmed the sparkle of her eyes
the sense of her ill fate struck her with grief:
T'm just a flower fallen from its branch,
and you're the butterfly that flits and flirts
No doubt, my lord keeps his own wedded wife:
why waste our brief few days on idle chat?
Since we have known each other, he replied,
my heart has nursed for you a steadfast love
But if we plan to live as lifelong mates,
I must retrace the stream to its own source
Lhumbly thank you for the thought, she said
But | fear snags on both your side and mine
If you have lingered in the house of mirth
you love this rose for its fair hue alone
Someday its bloom will fade, its scent will Fail
will you still keep for me a constant heart?
What's more, within the threshold of your home,
a mistress is already wielding sway
Till now the marriage bond has tied you two:
another woman will divide your love
A drifting cloud, a floating fern, am T
to drain your fond affection from your spouse?
Should things go topsy turvy thanks to me,
on whom will later fall high Heaven's scourge?
If with firm hand you hold the heim and steer,
you may protect me, shield me, now and then
But if the lady lords it over you,
I shall be tossed to her, your lioness
Under your roof I'll have to cringe and craw]
her vinegar will burn worse than hell's own fire!
Above your wife there is your father, too:
will he bestow some pity on this girl?
How can he love the rose picked off a wall?
He'll send the harlot back to harlotdom
With yet more dirt and filth T'll learn to live
but what I'm mindful of is your good name
If you love me, please keep our love intact
See that there's no loose end and I'll obey
He said: You speak with such a wary tongue!
Are they two strangers still, your heart and mine?
Think not of things as far as Wu or Laos:
depend on me to work all matters out
I'm near you do they count, all risks remote?
Tye sworn my troth T'll brave the winds and waves!
The two exchanged all secrets of their souls,
pledging their troth in sight of sea and hills
The night was much too short for love refrains
the moon had sunk behind the western heights
He feigned to take Kiều out for some fresh air
among bamboos and hid her at a place
Now he prepared to wage both war and peace,
seeking tacticians, asking help from spies
Then he sent word confronting that Dame Tú
she, outmaneuvered, could but sue for terms
He paid the ransom into her own hands
and notified the law of Kiều s release,
Once he had settled with both laws and men,
she soon escaped the circle of her woes
{As lovers joined their lives beneath one roof,
their love grew deeper, deeper than the sea
Like fire and incense, mutual passion burned
her jade and lotus beauty gleamed and glowed
For half year they lived as intimates
Now, in the courtyard, planes mixed gold with jade
Along the hedge, frost hardy mums peeped out
And lo, the father came a riding back
He stormed and thundered in his towering wrath
filled with concern, he thought to split the pair
Determined, he passed judgment straightaway:
inher old whorehouse he'd put back the whore
The father s verdict was clear cut, forthright
yet, making bold, the son entreated him:
know my many crimes if thunđerbolts
or hatchet blows strike me, I'll die content,
But now my hand has dipped in indigo:
a fool grown wise still can t undo what's done
Even if Thad her for just one day,
who'd hold a lute and then rip off its strings?
Ifyou will not relent and grant me grace,
Td rather lose my life than play her false
Those stubborn words aroused the old man bile,
so at the hall of law he lodged complaint
Over a peaceful earth the waves now surged:
the prefect sent a warrant for the pair
They walked behind the sheriff, then at court
they fell upon their knees, still side by side
They raised their eyes and saw an iron mask
the prefect, strutting power, spoke harsh words:
Young wastrel, you have had your foolish fling
and she, that slut, is nothing but a cheat
A cast off rose with all its scent gone stale,
she's put on rouge and powder, duping boors
To judge the state of things from his complaint,
it's out of jomt with either one of you
1 shall uphold the law and try the case
There are two paths you're free to opt for which:
either TÌI mete out punishment by the book
or to the whorehouse I'll remand the whore
Once and for all my mind's made up! she cried
The spider s web shall not catch me again
Muddy or clear, it's still my life to live
1 shall endure the thunder of the law!
The judge declared: The law be carried out!
A peony in shackles, cuffs, and cangue
Resigned, she dared not cry her innocence
tears stained her cheeks and pain knit tight her brows
Down on a floor of dust and mud, her face
a tarnished glass, her frame a thin plum branch
Oh, poor young Thúc! Consider his sad plight:
he watched her from afar, his entrails torn
She suffers so because of me! he moaned
Had I but listened, she'd be spared this wrong,
How ever can a shallow mind think deep?
So now I've caused her all this grief and shame
The judge had overheard young Thúc s lament
by pity moved, he asked for more details
At once the lover sobbed his story out,
recounting all she'd said when he proposed:
She pondered what might happen, soon or late,
aware that she herself could come to this
Because I chose to take it all in hand,
T've brought this woe on her it s my own fault
The judge felt sorry when he heard those words
he smoothed his brow and figured some way out
If what you've told me is the truth, he said,
this harlot, after all, knows right from wrong
Though just a lowly woman, Thúc went on,
she s learned to ply the brush and scribble verse
But she must be perfection! laughed the judge
Well, write a piece, The Cangue, and strut your art
The girl complied she raised the brush and wrote,
then laid the sheet of paper on his desk
It tops the height of T'ang! he cried in pr
All gold on earth can t buy her gifts and charms
The man of parts has met the woman fair:
a finer match could Chou and Ch en have bred?
Let s put an end to all this fight and feud
why sow discord and break a love duet?
When people come before a court of law,
inside the rules of justice mercy dwells
Your son's own mate belongs within your clan:
forget your own displeasure and forgive
A wedding he decreed wind borne, took off
the bridal carriage, torches raced the stars
A band of piping flutes and throbbing drums
Jed bride and groom to their connubial niche
Old Thúc admired her virtues, prized her gifts
from him no more harsh word or stormy scene
Lilies and orchids bathed their home in scents
as bitter sorrow turned to sweeter love
Time flew amidst delights of wine or chess:
peach red had waned, now lotus green would wax
Behind their curtains, on a silent night,
she felt misgivings, told him what she felt:
Since this frail girl found her support in you,
geese followed swallows almost gone, a year
Yet not a day's brought news from your own home
With your new bride, you've cooled toward your old mate
It seems, upon reflection, rather odd:
from talk and gossip who could have saved us?
The mistress of your household so I've heard
does what is proper, says what is correct
Oh, how I dread all such uncommon souls!
It s hard to plumb the ocean s pits and depths
We've lived together for these full twelve months
from her we could not have concealed the fact
If for so long you've got no news of her,
then something must be brewing in that hush
Now go back home immediately, I beg you:
you'll please her and we'll know what's in her mind
If you drag out this game of hide and seek
and put off telling her, it just won't work
He heard those words of counsel, said with calm,
and braced himself to think of going home
Next day he spoke to Father of his plans
the old man, too, urged him to make the trip,
To bid farewell and share the stirrup cup,
they left their sweet love nest for Mount Kao t'ing
The Ch in stretched off a ribbon of pale blue
along the bank, some willows waved goodbye
They moaned, still holding hands they left untouched
the parting cup and choked on parting words,
The hills and streams will sunder us, she said
But peace must reign at home to reign abroad
One sees a needle s eye if no red soarf
Blindfolded, who will try to catch a bir
A rather fragile bond now ties us two:
at home, spell it all out, make it all clear
Should she, displeased, object and raise a storm,
tell her I know my place and honor hers
Far better thus than try to cover up
and only hatch more mischief afterwards
If you love me, remember what I say
A year is quite some time, but it will pass,
To mourn this day, let's drain the parting eup
our cup of joy we'll drink twelve months from now
He climbed his horse, she let go of his gown
autumn was tinging maple woods with gloom
And off he rode as clouds of dust swirled up,
to vanish past all those green mulberry groves
She walked back home to face the night alone,
and by himself he fared the long, long way
Who split the lovers moon? Half stayed and slept
by her lone pillow, half lit his far road
Why tell what our wayfaring man went through?
Let's talk about the mistress of his hearth
Known as Miss Hoan, she wore a great clan name:
her father ruled the Civil Office Board
On happy winds of chance Thúc had met her,
and they had tied the nuptial knot long since
Living above reproach, Miss Hoan could wield
the surest hand in catching one at fault
His garden boasted now a fresh blown rose
so she had heard from every mouth but his
The fire of wrath kept smoldering in her breast
against the knave whose fickle heart had roamed:
If only he'd confessed, told me the truth,
Í might have favored her with my good grace
Td be a fool to lose my stately calm
and gain the stigma of a jealous shrew
But he s thought fit to pull his boyish prank
and hide his open secret what a farce!
He's fancied distance keeps me unaware
Let's hide and seek I too shall play his game,
1 entertain no worry on this score:
the ant's inside the cup where ean it craw]?
Til make them loathe and shun each other's sight
Tilerush her so she cannot rear her head
Til rub the spectacle in his bare face
and make the traitor feel my iron hand
She locked her anger deep inside her heart
and let all rurnors breeze right past her ears
Later, two louts came bearing their report
hoping to earn due wages for their pains
The lady in high dudgeon thundered forth:
loathe pert knaves who'll weave, embroider things!
My husband's not a common, vulgar chur:
mouths with less truth than froth have spat this lie
She bade her lackeys execute her law,
slapping their mouths and knocking out their teeth
An awestruck hush now settled on her house:
nobody risked another single peep
In her pink room she'd idle morn and eve,
she'd chat and laugh as if naught were amiss
While in her bosom, night and day, she seethed,
Jo, he came home, alighting from his horse
They spoke their joy, inquired each other's health
their love revived, theit ardor blazed again
Many a cup they drank to his return
but who could read what in their hearts each felt?
He had come home to sound his wife s intent
and, bit by bit, reveal the truth to her
Yet, gay or sober, as she talked and laughed,
she would not drop one hint of his affair
So far I've kept my mouth shut tight, he thought
Why should I'squeal when no one s sticking me?
He wavered, shilly shallied all the while,
afraid to pull a vine and shake the woods
At times, as back and forth they bandied jokes,
the lady would let fall some vague remark:
True love sorts jade from stone and gold from brass:
between us two has grown a perfect trust
Praise be to all those tongues which spin long yarns
they've peddled tales of your so called amours
Had reason failed me, I'd have fouled my mind
believing them, become ä laughingstock
Since she put it in casual, bantering tones,
he played along to parry blows and thrusts
They dallied, blending shadows by the lamp
or snugeling cheek to cheek beneath the moon,
To perch and fish cress he'd begun to take
when down the well planes dropped a few gold leaves
His soul recalled the world beyond the pass
where for four seasons he had loved and lived
Before he could make bold to breathe a word,
the lady guessed his mind and offhand said:
A year has gone since you lefl those white clouds:
regain Lin tau and care for your old sire
Her words unknit a knot within his breast!
His horse flew him across strange streams and hills:
waters, all gleaming, mirrors for the sky,
walls wreathed in sapphire mist, peaks gilt with sun
The moment he had cracked his whip and left,
she boarded her own coach to see her kin
Chapter and verse, she told her mother all
how he ở played false and how she'd borne her wrong:
A jealous tantrum's like an itch, I thought:
it shames the man, it earns the wife no praise
So T kept mum and looked the other way,
but already had my plan laid down,
By land it takes a month to reach Lin tzu
by sea, though, one will get there soon enough
ve picked some trusted lads to man a boat,
go there and bring her back, with feet in chains,
Then I'll drive her out of her mind and wits
TT torture her for all the world to see
First I'll discharge my spite on both, and next
Til make of both a mockery for all time
A master scheme, her mother praised the plot
she humored her and left her free to act
A vessel was rigged up with sails and yards:
two lackeys, Hound and Hawk, recruited thugs
After the crew was told what they should do,
before the wind the boat set sail for CHỈ
As Kiều sat by her window, all alone,
mixed threads of gloom ran crisscross in her soul
Their sun is setting, hanging at head's height
have they warm clothes, do they eat well or il?
The hair I clipped has reached my shoulders now:
what has become of all my vows of troth?
A clinging ivy thats my humble lot:
vill Heaven bless or curse this marriage tie?
Why have all wrongs and woes befallen me?
Oh, to live safe like Ch ang o in her hall!
An autumn night through windows wafts of breeze:
high in the sky, a crescent moon, three stars
To Heaven's altar she brought incense sticks
She was still pouring out her heart in prayer
when from the shrubs a wicked band sprang out
and screamed like devils spewed by hell itself
The courtyard was all gleaming with drawn swords
Frightened, she still knew not what was afoot
On her they sprayed a drug inducing drowse,
which left her senseless, slumbering in a dream
They picked her up, placed her astride a horse,
then set on fire his library, her own room
Beside the river lay a corpse, unclaimed:
they dragged it in, left it there in her stead
The servants, from whom terror had chased wits,
sought cover dashing into shrubs and groves,
Old Thúc, whose house was in the neighborhood,
was struck with panic seeing flames shoot up
Master and men all hurried to the spot
to quench the roaring blaze and search for Kiều
As rose the wind, so higher rose the flames
The servants looked and looked of her no trace
Wild eyed and frenzied, they all scuttled round
to peer at random into shrubs and wells
They fought their way and reached her inner room:
they saw a heap of cinders, bones charred black
Meaning no evil, who suspects foul play
They took it to be Kiều and no one else
Old Thúc broke into: sobs and tears he mourned
the virtuous mate his absent son had Lost
He had the ashes gathered and brought home,
then shrouded, coffined, and consigned to earth
All funeral rites for Kiều had been performed
when overland, at length, young Thúc came back
Where they'd hummed verse he now stepped in to find
a pile of cinders, four rain beaten walls
He rushed to Father s place in the middle room,
an altar had her tablet set thereon
Alas, the tragedy he was told in full
Love tore his heart and anguish burned his soul
He rolled upon the ground, he wept and moaned:
That death for such a woman, what a wrong!
1 was so sure we two would meet again
who could have known we said adieu for good?
Love wakened thoughts, and thoughts aroused more pain
who could stamp out his sorraw, quench his grief?
He learned that near those parts a shaman lived,
who summoned spirits knowing their dark realm
On the Three Isles or down by the Nine Springs,
he'd trace the whereabouts of all dead souls
Young Thức sent gifts and called the psychic in:
he bade him look for her, inquire her fate
Before the altar, down the shaman knelt
He kindled incense sticks, fell into trance
When he revived, he made a clear report:
I did not see her face but learned her fate
A karma of dine woe still weighs on her
with debts unpaid, how can she die as yet?
Her star does indicate she's in distress,
but you must wait a year for news of her
And when you two stand face to face again,
how strange, you will avoid each other's eyes!
When Thúc was told so weird a prophecy,
dared he believe such tidings of her fate?
It was rank hocus pocus, nothing more
Where could he hope to see her in this world?
He mourned his flower, bewailed their joys of spring:
how often does one meet a nymph on earth?
The fallen rose had washed downstream, he thought
he knew not she had found her hell on earth
Once Hound and Hawk had brought their scheme to pass
they carried Kiều aboard and laid her down
And then, all sails unfurled and halyards taut,
the skiff raced forth and crossed the waves for Hại
They landed, made straight for the palace where
they turned Kiều in to earn their due reward,
To servants quarters she was carried off
while she still lay unconscious, deep in sleep
Then, with a jolt, she wakened from her drowse
ther home had vanished whose mansion was this here?
Half conscious, half asleep, she fumbled yet
when a loud call came from the audience room
Housemaids rushed up to urge her prompt response
in mortal dread, she followed one of them
Her eyes glanced up and saw a stately hall,
inscribed above: Heaven's Prime Minister
And candles burned in broad day, right and left
There on a couch a lady sat enthroned
She queried Kiều, she probed her, root and branch
Kiều dutifully answered, told her life
A storm of fury burst upon her head:
Bút you're one of those vagabonds past all shame!
This wench is no good, decent woman, no!
She must have fled her man, if not her lord
A graveyard cat! A hen that prowls the fields!
You hemmed and hawed and could not clear yourself
Tve bought you soul and body you're my slave,
andl yet such airs and graces you display!
Where are you lasses who enforce my law?
Teach her a lesson deal her thirty strokes!
Yes, Ma am! all housemaids cried A hundred tongues
could not have helped poor Kiều defend herself
Sticks of bamboo belabored her whose flesh
would not break up, whose heart would fail to quake?
Pity a spray of peach, a sprig of plum,
once more exposed to storm and torn to shreds
Flower, the slave renamed by order, Kigu
was now impressed to toil as lady's maid
She joined the ranks of servants garbed in blue,
with hair unkempt and skin as dull as lead
Among the servants there, a stewardess,
observing Kiéu s sweet ways, befriended her
She'd give Kiều tea or medicine for her wounds
and some advice on how to stay alive:
Accept whatever happens, good or ill
a reed, though, should take care of its Frail self
Perhaps you must atone for some past sin,
but malice brought you here, and not pure chance
Beware around here walls have ears and eyes
Ifyou see your old friend, you look away,
or lightning bolts will strike you from the blue
When wronged, can flies and ants demand redress?
Her tears, like pearls, kept rolling down Kiều s cheeks
foreboding brewed and stirred within her soul
Tve had an ample share of life's foul dust,
and now this swamp of mud proves twice as vile
Will fortune never let its victims go
but in its snares and toils hold fast a rose?
| sinned in some past life and have to pay:
TI pay as lowers must fade and jade must break
While Kiều was taking refuge there for now,
one day Miss Hoan came home to see her folks
Mother and daughter talked of this and that,
and then the lady sent for Kiều to say
My daughter needs a slave to serve her wants:
Tllet you go and be her chambermaid
Kiều followed her new mistress and set out,
bound for what hell or heaven she knew not
Now, day or night, on hand with combs and towels,
she'd stand at beck and call, a model slave
One evening, all was calm the mistress asked
to hear Kiều play the lute, her love of yore
She did as bid, plucked strings and spilled such drops
of music as poured liquor in the soul
The lady seemed to like the lutanist s art:
her stern expression softened just a bit
Within a stranger's gate Kiều slaved and lived,
confiding in her shadow or her heart
To meet her Lin tzu spouse again, she thought
she'd have to wait until some future life
All heaven was one white expanse of clouds
she peered far into space: where was her home?
While months reeled on with worries close at hand,
could Thúc suspect what happened far away?
Since from Lin tzu his lovebird had flown off,
an empty chamber kept a lonesome man
He saw her eyebrow in the crescent moon,
breathed hints of old perfume and ached for her
Just as the lotus wilts, the mums bloom forth
time softens grief, and winter turns to spring
Where could he find her he had once so loved?
He called it fate and duller throbbed his pain
Nostalgia woke some yearning in his breast
and, sick for home, he made his long way back
She met him at the gate, she gushed with joy
Once they had traded news of health and such,
she had all drapes rolled up; then she bade Kiều
appear and greet the lord on his return
As Kiều came out, she faltered at each step,
for from a distance she perceived the truth:
Unless the sun and lights have tricked my eyes,
who else but my own Thic is sitting there?
So now I must confront the blatant Fact
beyond all doubt, she s caught me in her trap
Could such a hellish plot be hatched on earth?
Why has mankind so erred and bred a fiend?
As bride and groom we two were duly joined
she splits us into slave and master now
The face displays sweet smiles, but deep inside
the heart will scheme to kill without a knife
We stand as far apart as sky and earth:
alas, what now to say, what now to do?
She grew bewildered gazing at his face,
her heart a raveled knot of silken threads
Too awed to disobey, she bowed her head
and prostrated herself upon the floor
The husband was dismayed, at his wits end:
ˆ'Woe's me! But isn t she right here, my Kiều?
What cause or reason led her to this plight?
Alas, we're caught and I know by whose hands!
Lest he'd betray himself, he'd breathe no word
bbut could not stop his tears from spilling out,
His lady fixed him with a glare and asked:
You just came home why look so woebegone?
T just took off my mourning, answered he
Tthink of my lost mother and still grieve
She sang his praises: What a loving son!
Let s drink to your return, drown autumn gloom
Husband and wife exchanged repeated toasts,
while Kiều stood by and from the bottle poured
The lady would berate her, finding fault,
would make her kneel and offer up each drink
He'd act like one demented more and more
as tears kept flowing while the liquor ebbed
Averting eyes, he'd talk and laugh by fits:
then, pleading drunk, he'd try a safe retreat
You slave, the lady snapped, persuade the lord
to drain his cup or I shall have you thrashed
Grief bruised his vitals, panic struck his soul
he took the proffered cup and quafTed the gall
The lady talked and laughed as though half drunk
to crown the evening, she devised a sport
She said: That slave has mastered all the arts
she'll play the lute, treat you to some good piece
All dizzied, in a daze, Kiêu bowed and sat
before the thin gauze screen to tune the lute
Four strings together seemed to ery and moan
in tones that wrenched him who was feasting there
Both heard the selfsame voice of silk and wood
she smiled and gloated while he wept within,
When he could check his welling tears no more,
he stooped his head and tried to wipe them off
Again the mistress shouted at the slave:
Why play that doleful tune and Kill our joy?
Don t you give thought to anything you do?
Tl punish you if you distress the lord
He waxed more frantic still to lay the storm,
he'd hurriedly attempt a laugh, a grin
The waterclock now marked the night's third watch
the lady eyed their faces, looking pleased
She gloried in her soul: This sweet revenge
makes up for grief that festered in my breast
But shrunk with shame and choked with rage inside,
he nursed a wound that rankled more and more
To share one pillow they regained their niche
Kiều huddled by her lamp, awake all night:
So now she has unveiled her own true face
How weird, that jealous humor in her blood!
To split two lovebirds, she contrived it all
she'd part and tear us from each other's eyes
Now we're a gulf, a world apart she s all,
Tm nothing now; she s always right, I'm wrong
So gently it holds us, her irom hand!
How can we struggle free and save our love?
Frail woman that I was, Ï tripped and fell:
shall I be rescued whole from furious waves?
Alone, she brooded far into the night
as ebbed the lampion s oil, her tears still flowed
Kiều served there day and night Once, face to face,
the mistress asked the servant how she fared
She chose her words with care, gave this reply:
I sometimes sorrow for my lot in life
The lady turned to Thúc, requesting him:
0 Please grill the slave, pry loose the facts from her
He felt all torn and rent within his heart,
for he could not confess nor bear the scene
Afraid he'd draw more outrage on her head,
he ventured, in soft tones, to question her
s Head bowed, the girl knelt down upon the floor
and of her past wrote out a brief account
Submitted to the lady, it was read
it seemed to touch some chord inside her heart
Forthwith she handed it to him and said:
We should admire her gifts, deplore her woes
Had fortune favored her with wealth and rank,
she could have graced a palace cast in gold
A woman bobs upon the sea of life:
so blessed with talent, yet so cursed by fate!
Indeed, you speak the utter truth, he said
Misfortune s never spared a single rose
The rule has held since ages out of mind
show mercy, treat her with a gentler hand
The lady said: In her report she begged
a to make her home within the Void's great gate
Well, II be pleased to grant her that one wish
and help her break the cycle of her woes
There in our garden is the Kuan yin shrine,
with everblooming lotus, tall bo tree,
5 with many plants and flowers, rocks and pools:
let her go there to tend the shrine and pra:
The dawn's first glow was glimmering im the skies
they bore five offerings incense, flowers, and such,
led Kigu to Buddha's temple: there she pledged
to live by all three vows and five commands
For a cassock she doffed the slave's blue smock,
and as a nun she now was called Pure Spring
She was to light the temple morn and eve,
while Spring and Autumn served as altar maids
3 So Kiều took refuge in the garden, near
the Purple Grove, far from the world s red dust
What could she still expect of human ties?
Now she was spared one shame to sell her charms
At Buddha's feet she buried griefs by day
she'd copy texts, light incense up at night,
magic drops from Kuan yin's willow branch!
They quench lust s fire, wash earthly filth away
Since she put on a nun s drab brown attire,
the autumn moon had crossed the zenith twice
Behind barred doors, inside a close meshed net,
she talked in people's presence, wept unseen
Here stood the shrine and there his study lay:
though gate to gate, they were two worlds apart
While he was sighing, moaning deep within,
one day his wife went visiting her folks
Chance beckoned he slipped out and walked straight on
to reach the garden shrine and meet his love
He cried his anguish bursting into sobs,
and teardrops soaked the flap of his blue gown:
Tmust admit I have betrayed our troth
and let you singly shoulder all our woes
Outwitied by a woman, I've looked on,
heartsick and at a loss to tell the truth
Through my own fault you've come to grief pure jade
is mired in dirt, a life lost in its spring
Ob, I would brave all perils and all risks
to stay with you, in death if not in life
But to my forebears Ï still owe an heir
Til clench my teeth and cut our bond in two,
T break my vow could my next hundred lives
redeem the shame of one pledged word unkept?
She said: A small, frail skiff that rides the waves
may float or sink as fortune will dictate
While I was floundering in the swamp of vi
how could 1 ever hope to live till now?
It is my part to play a drop of rain
that falls at random as spectators watch
But lute and strings did come together once
wedded for some scant days if not for life
Please find me some safe exit from this cage:
you'll prove your love and earn my gratitude
Te nursed that thought in secret, he replied
How can one gauge a human heart's abyss?
Hear that, if and when a storm breaks out
it will wreak harm on you and grief on me
Try for your freedom run or fly away!
Our love has had its time this is the end
We two shall soon be traveling opposite paths:
when might we meet and pledge our troth anew?
Rocks crumble, streams run dry a silkworm, dead,
still clings on to the strand of silk it s spun
The past, the future both discussed at length
they talked and talked, undrained of tender words,
Eyes locked, hands clasped, the lovers would not part,
but from afar a housemaid flashed a cue
He swallowed down his shame and made to leave
in stalked the lady brushing flowers aside
All honey and all smiles, she greeted him
and asked: So, have you come here for a walk?
He groped for some excuse: While gathering flowers,
I stopped to watch her copy sacred texts
Such exquisite brush strokes! she cried in praise
Lan t ng engravings hardly excel them!
Alas, by life's strong tides she s tossed about,
a talent worth pure gold a thousand coins!
Both drank a Dhyana brew, red plum wood tea;
then, strolling, they regained their book lined room,
Kigu s gloom and dread increased under her breath,
she asked the housemaid what had taken place
The housemaid said: She was here all the while
she stood on tiptoe spying half an hour
She saw it all, missed not one bit or shred,
heard every word, and learned the full, whole truth:
all your sore trials, all your dire ordeals,
the master s fits of grief, your own laments
She bade me wait there standing to one side
she got her earful, then she went upstairs
Kiều heard and felt cold terror in her soul:
ll never look upon her like again
That was true self command, that was pure sham
The merest thought of her will make flesh creep
Where else to find a woman of such depths?
No wonder Thúc now lies bound hand and foot
When she caught us together, any wife
would in a jealous rage have scowled and snarled
But no, she made no trouble, kept her calm
she greeted with good cheer, she sweetly talked
An angry face reveals what stirs the heart,
but deep and mean are those who hate and smile
My life I must take into my own hands,
beware a tiger's jaws, a serpent's fangs
Unless I grow my wings and fly, some day
she'll nip the blossom off the tree she's hedged
A floating fern minds not the swift, strong stream
destined to drift, it drifts no matter where
But how, alone and lost on strangers soil,
shall I fight cold and hunger with bare hands?
Thoughts scurried back and forth and then she saw
some altar objects, gold or silver things:
she grabbed a few, hid them inside her dress
As she heard drumbeats sound the night's third watch,
she heaved herself and climbed across the wall,
then westward picked her way in moonset dusk
Through wooded hills, sand trails immersed in mist;
cockcrow from moon lit huts; fresh marks of shoes
on dew soaked bridge Along the path, at night,
a girl braved wind and weather walking on
The eastern sky glowed up, lit mulberry groves
forlorn, Kiều knew not where to find a home
Then, in the distance, loomed a Buddhist church
she read the sign: Retreat of Blessed Peace
She made straight for the entrance gate and knocked
a nun heard her, came out, and let her in
On seeing Kiéu in plain monastic garb,
Giác Duyên, kind hearted prioress, liked the girl
She asked about her past from root to top
yet feeling strange, Kiều skirted round the truth
This humble nun s a native of Peking
who's lived by Buddha's teaching for some time
Later, my prioress in her turn will come,
but she told me to bring you these two gifts
She took them out and showed a golden bell,
a silver gong she'd hỉdden on herself
The prioress cast an absent glance and said
So you've come from Hang Thúy, my good old friend?
It worries me to see you trek alone
stay here a day or two till she arrives
Kigu made a home of that small cloud locked church,
living on salt and greens in carefree days,
She'd chant old sutras she had learned by heart,
tend incense burners, tidy rooms and cells,
handle palm leaves, fly banners in the clouds,
light lamps at moonrise, ring the bell at dawn
The prioress found her mind above the norm
highly regarded, Kiều felt more secure
Now spring was ending flowers cast their shades
on earth, the Silver River crossed the sky
No wind, no cloud, a time of leisured ease~
a pilgrim came to worship at the shrine
Admiring both the gong and bell, she said:
But they look like the property of Miss Hoan!
Giác Duyên was truly worried by those words
in the still night, she queried Kiều again
Kiều could no longer keep her secret dark:
from top to bottom she retold her past
She added: Now that things have come this far
my weal or woe lies solely in your hands
When she had heard Kiéu s tale, the nun grew faint,
teetering between plain pity and dire dread
She whispered in Kiều 's ear and spoke her heart:
The Buddha s gate is open wide to all
But things I can t foresee are what I dread
Td sorely grieve if something struck you here
Plan far ahead and flee you'd be unwise
to sit and wait till waters reach your feet
Some people surnamed Bac lived nearby there,
avi camel Ni Meee in i SEZS<:
They were sent for, advised of all the facts,
and asked to shelter Kiều beneath their roof
Too glad to find a haven, Kiều rushed in
how could she stop to reckon distant risks,
suspect another lurking nest of thieves?
Dame Bạc soon proved a colleague of Dame Tủ
She crowed within at Kigu's unpainted charms:
she'd gotten what should yield a fat return
Out of thin air she would concoct her tales
and hold the girl on tenterhooks of fear
Repeating she would turn her out of doors,
she hurled dark threats to force a man on her:
Ten thousand miles from home you're all alone,
and all around you've spread a nasty name
You cursed breed, you will yet wreck our home
who else but us would dare to harbor you?
Grab the first chance you have and tie the knot,
or fly and hide in heaven if you can
Well, in these parts no match can be arranged,
nor is there any prospect farther off
But there s Bac Hạnh, a nephew dear to me,
my blood relation, not just any man
He owns and runs a trading shop in T ai:
there's none as honest never breaks his word
Listen to me and marry him you must
Once wedded, you can move with him to Tai
Who'll recognize you there? At large and free,
you'll rove the streams and seas just as you wish
If you refuse to give me your consent,
you'll go against my wish and come to grief,
Care knit Kiều s brows, gloom overcast ber face
the more she heard, the more it hurt like blows
She'd stumbled, falling where she could not fee
at bay, the quarry vented her despair:
I'm just a swallow strayed far from its flock
once wounded by a bow, it fears curved boughs
If, cornered, I must wed and serve a man,
how do I know him, know his face, his heart?
Should later it turn out that I have bought
ee re a a thái torre
can see the hero hid in common dust!
Your words prove you discern me from the rest
we'll sit together when I sit on high
Two minds at one, two hearts in unison
unbidden, love will seek those meant for love
Now he approached a go between through her
he paid some hundred liang for Kiều s release
They picked a quiet spot, built their love nest
a sumptuous bed and curtains decked with gods
The hero chose a phoenix as his mate;
the beauty found a dragon for her mount
A year half gone their love was burning bright,
but now he heard the call of all four winds,
He gazed afar on sea and heaven, then
he leapt into the saddle with his sword
`! woman's place is near her man, she said
IE go you must, I beg to go with you
We read each other's hearts, don't we? Tir said,
Yet you act like some vulgar woman why ?
When I can lead a hundred thousand men,
hen drumbeats shake the earth and banners throw
thick shadows on the road, when all the world
admires this hero, then I'll take you homne
There's nowhere I belong If you're to come,
you'll hinder me I know not where I'll go
Have patience just wait here for me a while:
I shall be back no later than a year
This said, he tore himself away and left
wind winged, the eagle scared to hunt the skies
Alone beside the window where greur plums,
she passed long nights within fast bolted doors
The courtyard mass bore no more marks of shoes
the weeds ran wild, but gaunt the willow grew
She peered through space to glimpse the elms back home
and, riding clouds, her fancy would fly there
For her old parents how it ached, her heart!
Had time allayed their sorrow at their loss?
With more than ten years gone, if still alive,
they must have skin with scales and hair like frost
Oh, how she pined and mourned for her old love
cut from her mind, it clung on to her heart
Tí her young sister had retied the knot,
she must be cuddling children in both arms
An exile's yearning thoughts of her far land
entwined and interwove with other cares
After the eagle vanished into space,
she kept her eyes fast set on heaven's edge
Inssilence she was waiting, night and day,
when through the region roared the flames of war
Gray phantoms, fumes of slaughter leapt the skies
as sharks roved streams and armored men prowled roads
Her friends and neighbors all exhorted her
to flee and somewhere stay out of harms reach
But she replied: 1 once gave him my word
though danger threatens, I shall not break faith
Perplexed, she was still wavering when, outside,
she now saw flags and heard the clang of gongs,
Armor clad troops had come and ringed the house
in chorus they all asked, Where is our queen?
Ten officers, in two rows, laid down their arms,
took of their coats, and Kowtowed on the ground
Ladies in waiting followed, telling her:
By order we'll escort you to our lord
The phoenix coach held ready for a queen
her glittering diadem, her sparkling robe
They hoisted flags, beat drums, and of they marched
musicians led the way, maids closed the rear
A herald rushed ahead the Southern Court
called all to its headquarters with the drum
On ramparts banners waved and cannons boomed
Lord Tir rode out to meet her at the gate
Turbaned and sashed, he looked unlike: hims
but he still had the hero's face of old
He laughed and said: When fish and water meet,
it's love! Remember what you told me once?
To spot a hero took a heroine
well, now, have I fulfilled your fondest hopes?
She said: I'm just a humble clinging vine
that by good luck may flourish in your shade
It's only now we see it all come true,
can see the hero hid in common dust!
Your words prove you discern me from the rest
we'll sit together when I sit on hỉgh
Two minds at one, two hearts in unison
unbidden, love will seek those meant for love

thick shadows on the toad, when all the world
admires this hero, then I'll take you home
There's nowhere I belong If you're to come,

It's only now we see it alll come true,
Á woman, though, should wield a gentle hand:
more cruelties she sows, more woes she reaps
The lady's wits and spirits all took flight
under the tent she bowed her head and cried
Thave a woman's mind, a petty soul,
and jealousy's a trait all humans share
But please recall I let you tend the shrine,
and when you fled I stopped pursuing you
felt esteem for you in my own heart
what woman, though, would gladly share her man?
Tm sorry | strewed thorns along your path
may I beseech your mercy on my fate?
In praise Kiều cried: To tell the truth, you boast
a matchless wit, you know just what to say
You have your luck to thank that I'l spare you,
for if I strike I'l look a small, mean soul,
You show a contrite spirit, as you should
She gave an order setting free Miss Hoan,
ho gratefully fell prostrate on the ground
Now a long string of captives crossed the gate
Kiêu said: High Heaven towers over alll
It's not my law that ill be paid with ill
Before their judge, Bạc Hạnh, Dame Bac came first,
then Hawk and Hound, these followed by Sở Khanh
and last, not least, Dame Tú and Scholar Ma
guilty as charged, how could they go scot free?
The executioner now received the word:
mete out such pains as fit each broken oath
Blood flowed in streams while flesh was hacked to bits
the scene struck terror into every soul
With Heaven rest all matters here below:
harm people and they'll harm you in their turn,
Perfidious humans who do fiendish deeds
shall suffer, crying quarter all in vain
All soldiers, crowded on the grounds, could watch
the scourge divine deal justice in broad day
When Kiều had paid due wages to them all,
Giác Duyên soon begged to take her leave Kigu said:
Once ina thousand years! Is that the most
the best of friends may ever hope to meet?
tTwo wanderers will part ways where shall I find
the crane, the cloud that roams the wilds and heights?
But it will not be long, the nun replied
Our paths will cross again within five years
As remember, on my pilgrim s way,
I chanced upon a prophetess, Tam Hop
She forecast you and I would meet this year,
then yet another time five twehvemonths hence
Indeed, her prophecy s not missed the mark:
once proven true, it shall prove true again
ur friendship still has many days ahead
Why worry? Karma still binds us two fast
Kiều said: Yes, destiny can be foreseen:
what she predicts shall doubtless come to pass
Should you encounter her along your road,
please bid her tell my fortune yet ahead
Gladly the nun agreed to that request,
then said goodbye and left for other parts,
Since she'd paid good for good or ill for ill,
her soul's deep sea of wrongs soon ebbed away
She knelt before Lord Tir to say her thanks:
Could this frail reed once hope to live this day?
For me your lightning brought the wicked low
and cast a load of sorrows off my soul
ve etched your favors in my heart, my bones
my life itself could not discharge such debts
Tir answered: Down the ages have great men
so often found that mate, that sister soul?
And does a man live up to his proud name
if he confronts a wrong and winks at i?
Besides, it was a family matter, too!
Need you bow low and offer me your thanks?
But you still have your parents I regret
that you should dwell in Yiieh and they in Ch'in
May you rejoin them both beneath one roof
and see their faces then, I'll rest at ease
Athis command, all gathered, spread the boards
to celebrate the just redress of wrongs
Bamboos split fast: tiles slip, soon fall apart:
his martial might now thundered far and wide
A woman, though, should wield a gentle hand
more cruelties she sows, more woes she reaps
The lady's wits and spirits all took flight
under the tent she bowed her head and cried:

All battlements tumbled down, inside and out

Who dare protest the word a mandazin speaks?
'Kiêu was compelled to wed a tribal chief
How waa yoda bế GÌ NGerassfrzodl,
at random tying couples with your threads!
The bridal carriage took her to his boat
curtains came down, the nuptial lamp lit up
Willow all withered, peach blossom all seared
hher freshness was all gone, not one spark left
Let waves and sands entomb her self, annul
her parents love and care, her gifts of mind
Mere flotsam seaborne toward the world s far bounds,
where could she find a grave and rest her bones?
Who had cut them, her silken threads of love?
And who had clapped on her this debt of woe?
How could a body sink to reach this state?
Each day on earth was just a wasted day
If while alive the body knows no joy,
why mourn a loss it will not know as loss?
Alone, she felt a hundred stabs of pain
she would destroy herself and end it all
The moon had slipped behind the western hills
Jonely, distraught, she walked and sat by turns
And then she heard the roar of rising tides
she asked and learned the river was Ch'ien t ang
She now recalled the name from her weird dream
So here my life of griefs shall meet its term
Dam Tiên, O friend, you know that I ve kept tryst?
You promised wait and welcome me down there!
A sheet was lying ready by the lamp:
she wrote a farewell poem as her will,
Parting the beaded curtain, she looked out:
high sky, broad stream one all pervading hue
Lord Tử so kindly treated me, she thought,
yet I betrayed him, sold him to the state
Tkilled my man, then took another man
how can I live and show my face on earth?
Why, I shall perish now and make an end
To waves and skies let me entrust my heart
She cast her eyes upon the shoreless space,
then headlong hurled her body in mid stream,
The tribal chief rushed up to rescue her
the fragrant gem had sunken out of sight
a life, an all too human life,
somehow cursed, alas, with charms and gifts
e wandered from one sorrow to the next
at would be left of her, at journey's end?
r fifteen years, how often she held up
nirror where all women see themselves!
me could have dropped to lower depths But dawn
sceeds the dark who knows the wheels of fate?
ust those true sons or daughters sorely grieve
fore high Heaven pities all their woes?
ce taking leave of Kiều, with gourd and bag
ác Duyên had trod her trail among the clouds
¢ met Tam Hop at leisure she inquired
out Kiều's destiny in full detail:
rue daughter, faithful lover she s proved both:
ty has she known but sorrow and distress?
Heaven gives weal or woe, the preacher said,
et from the human heart it also springs
; Heaven shapes our fate we lend a hand
snounce the world, reap joy to lust spins grief
u boasts a lavish share of charms and gifts,
d woe befalls a rose as her set lot
oreover, she has woven passion s web
herein at pleasure she'll enmesh herself
Aus, when she dwelt in those abodes of peace,
e would not stay, for she could not sit stil,
) fiends inspired, by demons led astray,
e left and darted down the path of thorns
le raced from woe to woe an inmate twice
those resorts of mirth, and twice a slave
sset with bristling spears and naked swords,
served a wolf, she did a tiger s will
idstream, as surged wild waves, she threw herself
tempt fell dragons jaws in their hushed depths
> passion sorrow clings and won't let go
ily she knows her pain, feels it alone
n earth she suffers torments fit for hell,
nd they shan t end until her lifetime ends
Giác Duyên heard that dire warning, shook with dread:
Of such a life, alas, what will be left?
But alls not lost, the prophetess replied
On balance every action weighs and counts
Vhen judged for her past sins, Kiều must be charged
th reckless love, but not with wanton lust
tequiting love for love, she sold herself
daughter's heart moved Heaven there on high
he caused one death, but saved ten thousand lives
he knew right thoughts from wrong, fair deeds from foul
Vhose merits equal her good works, in truth?
hey've all but washed away her sins of yore
feaven will sometimes choose to humor man
ho's purged past faults is due for future joys
iác Duyên, remember your own pledge to her
r her please float a raft down the Ch ien t ang
ou'll thus redeem a promise you once made:
falls on us to do what's Heaven blessed
Giác Duyên heard those good words her heart rejoiced
he went and settled on the Ch'ien t'ang shore
raiding some thatch, she built her hut: a home
etween the emerald waves and golden clouds
ear in year out, she hired two fishing men
) wait with boat and fishnet stretched across
he prayed with all her soul and grudged no pains:
trough Heaven's mill the meeting came to pass
After Kiều plunged, she rode the silver stream
te drifted with the current, reached this spot
he fishermen hauled their net, pulled her aboard
last, Tam Hop's prediction was fulfilled
1 her silk nightrobe dripping on the bow,
ugh drenched, she had not lost the gleam of life
iác Duyên could tell it was indeed Kiều s face,
ut she remained immersed in heavy sleep
Her soul was wandering through a grove of dreams
hen from the past appeared a friend, Dam Tiên
he said: With love I've been awaiting you
ve spent ten years and more just haunting here
ow frail your fate! Your virtues, though, how strong!
Who can match your true heart, despite past sins?
Heaven has noticed it: a loving child,
you sold yourself, an altruist, you saved lives
Your country and your people you served well
Such hidden merits have now tipped the scale
Your name's now struck from the Book of the Damned
your poems writ in sorrow T'll give back
With many days ahead, you shall fulfill
your great past love, reap future happiness
Still dreamy, Kiều knew not what to believe
when someone whispered in her ear Pure Spring!
She wakened with a start bemused and dazed,
she failed to recognize a single face
Dam Tiên she could find nowhere in the boat,
but at her side she soon could see Giác Duyên
Their mutual joy burst forth a hundred ways
They left the boat, went home to that grass hut
The two now shared one roof the moon and wind
cooled faces, while plain greens and salt cleansed hearts
A vast, vast space around tides rose and fell
from dawn to dusk within a cage of clouds
As Kiều shook of the filth of all past woes,
how could her erstwhile love know she lived here?
If Kiều had shouldered her full load of griefs,
young Kim himself had suffered much the while
For mourning rites he'd made that far flung trip
and from Liao yang came back in half a year
He hurried toward his dear Kingñsher`s nest
and took one startled look the scene had changed
The garden was a patch of weeds and reeds
Hushed, moon lit windows, weather beaten walls
Not one lone soul peach blossoms of last year
were smiling, flirting yet with their east wind
Swallows were rustling through the vacant house,
Grass clad the ground, moss hid all marks of shoes
At the wall s end, a clump of thorns and briers
this pathway both had walked a year ago
A silent chill was brooding over all
who could relieve the anguish of his heart?
A neighbor happened by approaching him,
Kim asked some questions he discreetly phrased
Old Vương? He'd somehow tangled with the law
And Kiều? She'd sold herself to ransom him
The family? All had moved a long way off
And what about young Vương and young Thủy Vân?
The two had fallen on hard days of need:
he sctibed, she sewed both lived from hand to mouth
Tt was a firebolt striking from mid sky:
Kim heard the news, was staggered by it all
He asked and learned where all those folks had moved
he slowly found his way to their new home
A tattered hut, a roof of thatch, mud walls;
reed blinds in rags, bamboo screens punched with holes;
a rain soaked yard where nothing grew but weeds:
the sight distressed and shocked him all the more
Still, making bold, he called outside the wall
Young Vương, on hearing him, rushed out at once
he took him by the hand, led him inside
From their back room the parents soon appeared,
They wept and wailed as they retold their woes:
Young man, you know what happened to us all?
Our daughter Kiều is cursed by evil fate:
she failed her word to you, her solemn troth
Disaster struck our family, forcing her
to sell herself and save her father s life
How torn and wrenched she was when she left home!
Grief bowed, she told us time and time again:
since she had sworn to you a saered oath,
she begged her sister Van to take her place
and in some way redeem her pledge to you
But her own sorrow will forever last
In this existence she broke faith with you
she'll make it up to you when she s reborn
These were the words she said and said again
we graved them in our souls before she left
O daughter Kiều, why does fate hurt you so?
Your Kim is back with us, but where are you?
The more they spoke of Kiều, the more they grieved
the more Kim heard them speak, the more he ached
He writhed in agony he sorely wept,
his face tear drowned and sorrow crazed his mind
Ithurt him so he fainted many times
and, coming to, he shed more bitter tears
When he saw Kim so desolate, old Vuong
curbed his own grief and sought to comfort him:
The plank s now nailed and fastened to the boat
UL starred and doomed, she can t requite your love
Although you care so much for her you've lost,
must you throw off a life as good as gold?
To soothe his pain, they tried a hundred ways
atief, smothered, flared and burned more fiercely yet
They showed him those gold bracelets from the past
and other keepsakes: incense, that old lute
The sight of them rekindled his despair
it roused his sorrow, rent his heart again
Because I had to go away, he cried,
Tlet the fern, the flower float downstream
We two did take and swear our vows of troth,
vows firm as bronze or stone, not idle words
Though we have shared no bed, we're man and wife:
how could I ever cast her from my heart?
Whatever it may cost in gold, in time,
I shall not quit until I see her face
He suffered more than all the words could say
stifling his sobs, he bade goodbye and left
He hurried home, arranged a garden lodge,
then he went back to fetch K iéu s parents there
He saw to their well being day and night
like their own son, in their lost daughter's stead
With ink and tears he wrote away for news
agents he sent and missives he dispatched
Who knows how much he spent on things, on men,
and several times he trekked to far Lin ch ing
He would search here while she was staying there
Where should he look between the sky and sea ?
He yearned and pined he seemed to have his soul
inside a kiln, his heart beneath a plow
The silkworm, spinning, wasted day by day:
the gaunt cicada, bit by frost, shrank more,
He languished, half alive, half dead he'd weep
real tears of blood, but lose his soul to dreams
His parents took alarm because they feared
what, gone too far, his grief might lead him to,
In haste they readied things and chose a date:
an early marriage tied young Kim and Van
A graceful girl, a brilliant scholar wed,
tuniting charms and gifts in their full flush
Though he found joy in matrimonial life,
how could this happiness outweigh that grief?
They lived together as he came to care
for his new union, surged his love of old
Whenever he remembered Kiéu's ordeal,
he wept and felt a tightened knot inside
At times, in his hushed study, he would light
the incense burner, play the lute of yore
Silk strings would sigh sweet moans while scentwood smoke
spread fragrant wisps and breezes stirred the blinds
Then, from the steps beneath the roof, he'd hear
a girl's faint voice he'd glimpse what seemed a skirt
Because he'd etched his love in stone and bronze,
he'd dream of her and think she had come back,
His days and nights were steeped in dismal gloom
while spring and autumn wheeled and wheeled about
For learned men a contest now took place:
young Vương and Kim attained the honor roll
Heaven s broad gate swung open flowers hailed them
in His Majesty's park, fame reached their heaths
Young Vương still kept in mind those days long past:
he called on Chung to settle his great debt
He paid it off in full, then took to wife
Chung s daughter, thus allying their «wo clans
As Kim stepped briskly on amidst blue clouds,
he thought of Kiều and sorrowed all the more
With whom had he exchanged those vows of troth?
With whom was he now sharing jade and gold? :
Poor fern afloat down in the troughs of waves
with honors blessed, he mourned her wandering life
Then he was sent to serve in far Lin tzu:
with loved ones he trekked over hill and dale
Now, in his yamen, he lived leisured days
amidst the lute's sweet sounds, the crane s soft cries
Ona spring night, in her peach curtained room,
asleep Van dreamed and saw her sister Kiều
When she awoke, she told her spouse at once
He wondered, torn between mistrust and hope:
Lin ch'ïng, Lin tzu they differ by one word:
they may have been mistaken each for each
Two sisters, kindred souls, met in a dream
perchance, we shall receive good tidings here
Now, working in his office, he inquired
Old Đô, one of his clerks, gave this report:
tall began more than ten years ago
1 knew them all quite well, each name, each face
Dame Ti and Scholar Ma went to Peking
they purchased Kiều and brought her back with them
In looks and gifts she stood without a peer
She played the lute and wrote both prose and verse
She wished to save her virtue, fiercely fought
and tried to kill herself, so they: used tricks
She had to live in mud till she turned numb,
then marriage ties attached her to young Thúc
But his first wife laid cruel hands on her
and held her in Wu hsi to nip the flower
When she betook herself from there and fled,
bad luck would have her fall among the Bạcs
No sooner caught than she was sold once more:
a cloud, a fern, she drifted here and there
She happened on a man: he beat the world
in wit and grit, shook heaven by sheer might
Leading a hundred thousand seasoned troops,
he came and stationed them throughout Lin tzu
Here Kiều cleared off all scores from her sad past
she rendered good for good or ill for ill
She proved her loyal heart, her kindly soul
she paid all debts, won praise from near and far
1 did not get to know the hero s name
for this detail please query Scholar Thúc
Alter he heard old Độ š clear drawn account,
Kim sent his card and bade Thúc visit him
He asked his guest to settle dubious points:
Where is Kiều s husband now? And what's his name?
Thúc answered: Caught in those wild times of strife,
Tprobed and asked some questions while at camp
The chieftain s name was Hải, his surname Tir
he won all battles, overwhelmed all foes
He chanced to meet her while he was in T'ai
genius and beauty wed, a natural course
For many years he stormed about the world:
his thunder made earth quake and heaven quail!
He garrisoned his army in the East
since then, all signs and clues of him are lost
Kim heard and knew the story root and branch
anguish and dread played havoc with his heart:
Alas for my poor leaf, a toy of wind:
When could she ever shake the world s foul dust?
As flows the stream, the flower s swept along
1 grieve her wave tossed life, detached from mine
From all our broken pledges I still keep
a bit of incense there, and here this lute
Its sou! has fled the strings will incense there
give us its fire and fragrance in this life?
While she s now wandering, rootless, far from home,
how can I wallow in soft ease and wealth?
His seal of office he'd as soon resign
then he would cross all streams and scale all heights,
then he would venture onto fields of war
and risk his life to look for his lost love
But heaven showed no track, the sea no trail
where could he seek the bird or find the fish?
While he was pausing, waiting for some news,
who knows how often cycled sun and rain?
Now from the throne, on rainbow tinted sheets,
arrived decrees that clearly ordered thus:
Kim should assume new office in Nan pi
Vương was transferred to functions at Fu yang
In haste they purchased horse and carriage, then
both families left together for their posts
The news broke out: The rebels had been crushed
waves stilled, fires quenched in Fukien and Chekiane
Informed, Kim thereupon requested Virong
to help him look for Kiều along the way
When they both reached Hang chow, they could obtain
precise and proven facts about her fate
This they were told: One day, the fight was joined
Tit, ambushed, fell a martyr on the field
Kigu s signal service earned her no reward
by force they made her wed a tribal chief
She drowened that body fine as jade, as pear!
the Ch'ien t'ang river has become her grave
Ab, torn asunder not to meet again!
They all were thriving she had died foul death
To rest her soul, they set her tablet up,
installed an altar on the riverbank
The tide cast wave on silver crested wave:
gazing, all pictured how the bird had dropped
Deep love, a sea of griefs so strange a fate!
Where had it strayed, the bird's disconsolate soul?
How queerly fortune's wheel will turn and spin!
Giác Duyên now somehow happened by the spot
She saw the tablet, read the written name
She cried, astonished: Who are you, my friends?
Are you perchance some kith or kin of hers?
But she s alive! Why all these mourning rites?
They heard the news and nearly fell with shock
All mobbed her, talked away, asked this and that:
Her husband here, her parents over there,
and there her sister, brother, and his wife
From truthful sources we heard of her death,
but now you tell us this amazing news!
Karma drew us together, said the nun,
first at Lin tzu, and next by the Ch'ien U ang
When she would drown her beauteous body there,
I stood at hand and brought her safe to shore
She's made her home within the Bodhi gate~
our grass roofed cloister s not too far from here
At Buddha feet calm days go round and round,
but her mind s eye still fastens on her home
At what was heard all faces glowed and beamed:
could any bliss on earth exceed this joy?
The leaf had left its grove since that dark day,
they'd vainly searched all streams and scanned all clouds
The rose had fallen, its sweet scent had failed:
they might see her in afterworlds, not here
She'd gone the way of night, they dwelt with day
now, back from those Nine Springs, she walked on carth
All knelt and bowed their thanks to old Giác Duyên,
then in a group they followed on her heels
They cut and cleared their way through reed and rush
their loving hearts half doubting yet her word
By twists and turns they edged along the shore,
pushed past that jungle, reached the Buddha s shrine
Ina loud voice, the nun Giác Duyên called Kiều,
and from an inner room she hurried out
She glanced and saw her folks they all were here:
Father looked still quite strong, and Mother spry:
both sister Van and brother Quan grown up:
and over there was Kim, her love of yore
Could she believe this moment, what it seemed?
Was she now dreaming open eyed, awake?
Tear pearls dropped one by one and damped her smock
she felt such joy and grief, such grief and joy
She cast herself upon her mother's knees
and, weeping, told of all she had endured:
Since I set out to wander through strange lands,
a wave tossed fern, some fifteen years have passed
Tsought to end it in the river's mud
who could have hoped to see you all on earth?
The parents held her hands, admired her face:
that face had not much changed since she left home
The moon, the flower, lashed by wind and rain
for all that time, had lost some of its glow
What scale could ever weigh their happiness?
Present and past, so much they talked about!
The two young ones kept asking this or that
while Kim looked on, his sorrow turned to joy
Before the Buddha s altar all knelt down
and for Kiéu s resurrection offered thanks,
Atonee they ordered sedans decked with flowers
old Vương bade Kiều be carried home with them
Pm nothing but a fallen flower she said
I drank of gall and wormwood half my life
thought to die on waves beneath the clouds
how could my heart nurse hopes to see this day?
Yet I've survived and met you all again,
and slaked the thirst that long has parched my soul
This cloister s now my refuge in the wilds
to live with grass and trees befits my age
Tm used to salt and greens in Dhyana fare;
Tve grown to Jove the drab of Dhyana garb
Within my heart the fire of lust is quenched
why should I roll again in worldly dust?
What good is that, a purpose half achieved?
To nunhood vowed, Ill stay here till the end
Towe to her who saved me sea deep debis
how can I cut my bonds with her and leave?
Old Vương exclaimed: Other times, other tides!
Even a saint must bow to circumstance
You worship gods and Buddhas who'll discharge
ca daughter's duties, keep a lover's vows?
High Heaven saved your life we'll build a shrine
and have our Reverend come, live there near us
Heeding her father s word, Kiều had to yield:
she took her leave of cloister and old aun,
The group returned to Kim's own yamen where,
for their reunion, they all held a feast
After mum wine instilled a mellow mood,
Van rose and begged to ait a thought or two:
It's Heaven's own design that lovers meet,
so Kim and Kiều did meet and swear their troth
Then, over peaceful earth wild billows swept,
and in my sister s place I wedded hirm,
Amber and mustard seed, lodestone and pin!
Besides, when blood is spilt, the gut turns soft
Day after day, we hoped and prayed for Kigu
with sơ much love and grief these fifteen years
But now the mirror cracked is whole again:
wise Heaven's put her back where she belongs
She still loves him and, luckily, still has him
still shines the same old moon both once swore by
The tree still bears some three or seven plums,
the peach stays fresh it's time to tie the knot!
Kiều brushed her sister's speech aside and said:
Why now retell a tale of long ago?
We once did pledge our troth, but since those days,
my life has been exposed to wind and rain
Trả die of shame discussing what's now past
Jet those things flow downstream and out to sea!
A curious way to put it! Kim cut in
Whatever you may feel, your oath remains
A vow of troth is witnessed by the world,
by earth below and heaven far above
Though things may change and stars may shift their course,
sworn pledges must be kept im life or death
Does fate, which brought you back, oppose our love?
We two are one why split us in two halves?
A home where love and concord reign, Kiều said,
whose heart won t yearn for it? But I believe
that to her man a bride should bring the scent,
ofa close bud, the shape of a full moon
Its priceless, chastity by nuptial torch,
am Ï to blush for what I'll offer you?
Misfortune struck me since that day the flower
Fell prey to bees and butterflies, ate shame
For so long lashed by rain and swept by wind,
a flower s bound to fade, a moon to wane
My cheeks were once two roses what s now left?
My life is done how can it be remade?
How dare I, boldfaced, soil with worldly filth
the homespun costume of a virtuous wife?
You bear a constant love for me, I know
but where to hide my shame by bridal light?
From this day on I'l shut my chamber door:
though Ï will take no vows, I'l ive a nun,
If you still care for what we both once felt,
let's turn it into friendship let's be friends
Why speak of marriage with its red silk thread?
It pains my heart and further stains my life
How skilled you are in spinning words! Kim said
You have your reasons others have their own
Among those duties falling to her lot,
a woman's chastity means many things
For there are times of ease and times of stress:
in crisis, must one rigid rule apply?
True daughter, you upheld a woman's role:
what dust or dirt could ever sully you?
Heaven grants us this hour: now from our gate
all mists have cleared; on high, clouds roll away
The faded fiower's blooming forth afresh,
the waning moon shines more than at its full
What is there left to doubt? Why treat me like
another Hsiao, a passerby ignored?
He argued, pleaded, begged she heard him through
Her parents also: settled on his plans
Outtalked, she could no longer disagree:
she hung her head and yielded, stifling sighs
They held a wedding feast bright candles lit
all flowers, set aglow the red silk rug
Before their elders groom and bride bowed low
all rites observed, they now were man and wife,
In their own room they traded toasts, still shy
of their new bond, yet moved by their old love
Since he, a lotus sprout, first met with her,
a fresh peach bud, fifteen full years had fled
To fall in love, to part, to reunite
both felt mixed grief and joy as rose the moon
The hour was late the curtain dropped its fringe:
under the light gleamed her peach blossom cheeks
Two lovers met again out of the past,
a bee, a flower constant in their love
Tve made my peace with my own fate, she said
What can this cast off body be good for?
I thought of your devotion to our past
to please you, I went through those wedding rites
But how ashamed I felt in my own heart,
lending a brazen front to all that show!
Don t go beyond the outward marks of love
erhaps, I might then look you in the face,
But if you want to get what they all want,
glean scent from dirt, or pluck a wilting flower,
then we'll flaunt filth, put on a foul display,
and only hate, not love, will then remain
When you make love and I feel only shame,
then rank betrayal's better than such love
If you must give your clan a rightful heir,
you have my sister there s no need for me
What little chastity I may have saved,
am I to fling it under trampling feet?
More tender feelings pour from both our hearts
why toy and crumple up a faded flower?
An cath bound us together, he replied
We split, like fish to sea and bird to sky
Through your long exile how I grieved for you!
Breaking your troth, you must have suffered so
We loved each other, risked our lives, braved death
now we two meet again, still deep in love
The willow in mid spring still has green leaves
| thought you still attached to human love
But no more dust stains your clear mirror now:
your vow can t but increase my high regard
If long searched the sea for my lost pin,
it was true love, not lust, that urged me on
We're back together now, beneath one roof:
to live in concord, need two share one bed?
Kiều pinned her hair and straightened up her gown,
then knelt to touch her head in gratitude:
If ever my soiled body's cleansed of stains,
Til thank a gentleman, a noble soul
The words you spoke came from a kindred heart
no truer empathy between two souls
A home, a refuge what won't you give me?
My honor lives again as of tonight
Their hands unclasped, then clasped and clasped again
now he esteemed her, loved he all the more
They lit another candle up, refilled
the incense urn, then drank to their new j
His old desire for her came flooding back
he softly asked about ber luting skill
Those strings of silk entangled me, she said,
in sundry woes which haven t ceased till now
Alas, what s done regrets cannot undo
but P'll obey your wish just one more time
Her elfin fingers danced and swept the strings
sweet strains made waves with curls of scentwood smoke
Who sang this hymn to life and peace on earth?
Was it a butterfly or Master Chuang?
And who poured forth this rhapsody of love?
The king of Shu or just a cuckoo bird?
Clear notes like pearls dropped in a moon lit bay
Warm notes like crystals of new Lan t'ien jade
His ears drank in all five tones of the scale
all sounds which stirred his heart and thrilled his soul
Whose hand is playing that old tune? he asked
What sounded once so sad now sounds so gay!
Is from within that joy of sorrow comes
have bitter days now set and sweet ones dawned?
This pleasant little pastime, answered she,
once earned me grief and woe for many years
For you my lute just sang its one last song
henceforth, PHI roll its strings and play no more
The secrets of their hearts were flowing still
when cocks crowed up the morning in the east
Kim spoke, told all about their private pact
All marveled at her wish and lauded her
a woman of high mind, not some coquette
who'd with her favors skip from man to man
Of love and friendship they fulfilled both claims
they shared no bed but joys of lute and verse
Now they sipped wine, now played a game of chess,
admiring flowers, waiting for the moon
Their wishes all came true since fate so willed,
and of two lovers marriage made two friends
As pledged, they built a temple on a hill,
then sent a trusted man to fetch the aun
When he got there, he found doors shut and barred
he saw a weed grown rooftop, moss filled cracks
She'd gone to gather simples, he was told
the cloud had flown, the crane had fled but where?
For old times sake, Kiều kept the temple lit,
its incense candles burning night and day
The twice blessed home enjoyed both weal and wealth
Kim climbed the office ladder year by year
Van gave him many heirs: a stooping tree,
a yardful of sophoras and cassia shrubs
In rank or riches who could rival them?
Their garden throve, won glory for all times
This we have learned: with Heaven rest all things
Heaven appoints each human to a place
If doomed to roll in dust, we'll roll in dust;
we'll sit on high when destined for high seats,
Does Heaven ever favor anyone,
bestowing both rare talent and good luck?
In talent take no overweening pride,
for talent and disaster form a pair
Our karma we must carry as our lot
let's stop decrying Heaven's whims and quirks
Inside ourselves there lies the root of good:
the heart outweighs all talents on this earth
May these crude words, culled one by one and strung,
'beguile an hour or two of your long night
