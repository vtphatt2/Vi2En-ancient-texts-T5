1 The Southern emperor rules the Southern land
The Southern emperor rules the Southern land
Our destiny is writ in Heaven’s Book
How dare ye bandits trespass on our soil
Ye shall meet your undoing at our hands
2 The Bachdang River
Blue peaks are swords and lances thrust at clouds
The dragon swallows waves and spews white spray
After spring rain flowers deck the earth like gems
in chilly winds pines hum and stir the sky
Open your eyes admire your timeless land
bow and recall the strife of Viéts and Huns
Down goes the sunthe river’s flowing red
is that the blood undried of those war killed
3 Farewell to two envoys from the Yiian court
Posthorses galloped through miasmal wilds
You brought your star to light this seaside realm
A hero’s will can face the world at large
a sovereign’s heart should treat all men alike
Yiich hills and streams give poets peerless lines
Chou rain and dew pour from the emperor’s writ
Tomorrow we shall sunder South and North
today do not turn down this cup of wine
4 A womb’s own flesh and bonestrong brotherhood
A womb’s own flesh and bonestrong brotherhood
From one root spring all branches north and south
Don’t covet more rice fields than you can till
Let not the lowly climb and sit on top
Chopped off an arm or leg will not grow back
torn up a shirt and skirt can be replaced
Learn to give way and yieldall will go well
Know both when to act hard when to act soft
5 The Bachdang River
Blue limpid water smoothly flows like oil
A thousand tributaries feed this stream
Those fools from Wu have all been washed away
vassals of Viét have all been cleansed of dirt
The throne stands strong highsoaring like Mount T’ai
Where has it wandered off Omar’s lost soul
The world’s at peaceall sharks lie still as rice
Let’s take our ease and cast our nets or lines
6 Homage to the Trung queens
To slay the people’s foe and wreak revenge
two sisters took up arms for their just cause
One battle put Su Ting’s scared wits to rout
a hundred tribes rose up to guard Lingnan'
They climbed the thronelarge bounties they bestowed
They donned their crownssweet blessings they conferred
While streams and hills endure their shrine shall stand
a monument to peerless womanhood
7 The old banyan tree
It finds a home amid the woods and brooks
When springtime comes it dons the green of spring
Not good enough for pillars and for beams
it shelters common folk beneath its shade
8 He tends the tree who wants to eat the fruit
He tends the tree who wants to eat the fruit
Peruse your books and soon or late you’ll know
A broken rope can’t hold the fiery horse
high office will not seek a stupid man
To rule the realm first straighten up your heart
Let water mirror radiance from the moon
Ungifted you are not called on to serve
don’t say the sovereign has forgotten you
9 The conduct of kings
Ponder the Ruler’s Way with utmost care
Feed men on earth fear Heaven throned above
Protect the realmwalk in the ancients’ steps
Cleanse cravings from the heartgo on no hunt
Wide choice of talents spreads the scholar’s faith
Weapons in plenty build the soldier’s pride
Light your jade torch and see your subjects’ needs
May we and all our neighbors live at peace
10 A king’s portrait
The people’s welfare is his first concern
High Heaven’s mandate he dare not neglect
Drums beat a nightwatch shifthe still reads books
The sun is going downhe yet holds court
In crisis able men reveal themselves
To circumstance wise policies adapt
Don’t say the goldrobed person does no work
reports on all state matters reach his ear
11 King and subjects
Of all five norms observed from first to last’
the code of king and subjects stands supreme
Ranks high and low reflect the cosmic plan
To land and people give your love and care
By virtue Shun enlisted Kao and K’uei
With kindness T’ang recruited Yi and Chung
Make cheer Sageking and loyal subjects meet
Your common glory shall endure and shine
12 Staffs and hats
They’re paltry objects when denied their roles
but they work wonders put to rightful use
In peril upright staffs defend the lord
from weather broadbrimmed hats protect all men
A staff keeps peace and plenty through the land
a hat gives shade and shelter to the world
They make all marvels happen when at work
the hand wields power the head directs and leads
13 Ode to the toad
From birth he’s worn a homespun cotton shirt’
He sits in his deep sanctum all alone
He briefly lifts his armsall tigers cringe
He often clicks his tongueall ants withdraw
He’s glad to see his children land for warmth
He may yet wed the beauty in the moon°
His temple rings with his imperious voice
he saves the people from the blight of drought
14 Ode to the watermelon
As sweet as jackfruit cool like coconut juice
a melon’s unsurpassed for slaking thirst
Its subtle scent is loved by everyone
of its rare flavor all the world is fond
Red heartit never fails to serve the lord
Green coatit brings rich bounty on the clan
Grown in good earth it bears abundant fruits
its offspring will forever wax and thrive
15 Ode to the betel palm
The lord has raised and nursed it all along
Its trunk shoots up grows taller every year
Uncounted sons and daughters bless its home
Warmgreeted guests and callers throng its house
Many rainlaundered girdles deck its waist
A lofty parasol protects its head
Proud pillar it stands straight beneath the skies
Let windstorms rageit never lists and falls
16 Ode to the sewing needle
Welltempered it stays straight and will not warp
don’t try to bend it into some vile hook
With skill it interweaves five hues of thread
to beauty it can add four seasons’ flowers
It’s fondled by soft hands in halls of state
to feasts it sends fine guests adorned with silk
It sews the dragonrobeits task supreme
In service it’s unmatched by Chung Shanfu
17 Three ranks of men three grades of things
There are three ranks of men three grades of things
It’s wise to know that flowers now bloom now fade
A feast is spread awaiting worthy guests
the seats of state wait ready for high skills
Must we let vulgar hands draw Heaven’s sword
Should wicked scoundrels hone the crescent ax
Allseeing majesty shines there on high
need any person cry and hawk pure gold
18 The village crier
His voice rings loud and carries far
He dawdles not but swiftly acts
His drum resounds throughout the world
his bell chimes forth to every place
Both young and old heed his appeal
the entire realm obeys his word
Once duties are assigned to all
he sits at ease on his own mat
19 In praise of the hat
It’s round full round yet not a hollow thing
It shelters and protects on all four sides
Left there it looks just like a parasol
once on it will defy both sun and rain
It covers every head and favors none
from dawn to dark it staunchly serves the chief
Aloft it sits positioned at the top
a grateful world takes refuge underneath
20 In praise of the broom
It stoops to labor at the lord’s behest
named marshal it must sweep all dust away
A single hand stirs windstorms in the sky
in all four quarters thorns are cleared from earth
Still daysit hangs in mansions like a cloud
clear nightsit sleeps in towers beneath the moon
Its heart of straw and fiber frays in time
a girdle it still keeps though worn to shreds
21 Ask to be put in charge of streams and hills
Ask to be put in charge of streams and hills
For you know naught about the world of men
Pick firewood near the cloudsbamboo galore
Hear music in the windsweet hum of pines
By day leave doors unlocked watch flowers drop
At nightfall roam the grove and welcome birds
Hide out like one who fishes or cuts wood
Stop speaking of the countryis it yours
22 For years you wallowed in the scholar’s world
For years you wallowed in the scholar’s world
Much time you wasted telling dolts from fish
Beware your mouth and stop it like a jar
conceal a heart as hollow as bamboo
The swallows have deserted Wang and Hsieh
a fan in fall means grief for Lady Pan
Better withdraw and mind your own affairs
Reform your waysleave books and such alone
23 Among the great no smooth and open world
Among the great no smooth and open world
At home a lord enjoys his mums and pines
Desponding like Shaoling you have turned gray
blithe as Peihai you can yet fill your cup
Don’t touch plum trees and mar their jadelike buds
mulch your bamboos and raise their dragonshoots
The public welfare still concerns your heart
24 Tired legs won’t climb the high road of blue clouds
Tired legs won’t climb the high road of blue clouds'
Go back to quiet scenes of your old home
No smell of rue when autumn spreads its chill
A boat lies on white sands as dips the moon
The king once lavished love and care on you
One slipthe race for honors comes to grief
Your debts to king and father you still owe
they keep you wideawake all through the night
25 Both favor and disgrace you have full known
Both favor and disgrace you have full known
now you walk free of what men think and do
Those in high posts are sages idlers fools
Grieve not at loss nor gloat at gain
Content and safe from danger stay at home
refrain from offering your Twelve Points for Peace
Is there a kindred heart that feels with yours
Above the western hills a lonesome moon
26 Clouds float through dreams
Clouds float through dreams are nowhere to be seen
you’ve borne and shed the load of rank and wealth
Stars shift things change within the realm of kings
streams flow flowers drop outside the gate of lords
Life is a game of chess played here and there
men’s hearts are seas with shallow waves and deep
Speak out or notwhat difference does it make
Keep brooding and your head will soon turn white
27 Time and again you’ve seen them win or lose
Time and again you’ve seen them win or lose
for leisure you’ve exchanged their hectic world
You take your own sweet ease at the White Cloud’
so loath to plod your way through dust and mud
They visit you till darkthe flowers your guests
It sees your heart at nightthe moon your lamp
Don’t glance past thingslook closely you can tell
vermilion will stay red and ink pitchblack
28 Before the world of power you'll fold your arms
Before the world of power you'll fold your arms
you'll gladly spare yourself so many griefs
Plum blossoms dim as moonlight shines too bright
bamboos cast shadows swaying where wind blows
You don’t forget your past concern and love
of present rights and wrongs you shall not speak
You’ve traveled through the human realm and learned
how many pitfalls lie along the road
29 Advice to students
Through your own efforts learn and Heaven helps
Let’s save old books and study them with care
To read proves quite an act in these foul times
even wise heads have found it hard to teach
By knowledge feed the mind flows like a stream
with few desires the body fears no threat
Purge man of greed and Heaven’s truth will shine
must scholars think of stipends and naught else
30 Exhortation to learning
The court holds open contests for good men
my son apply your mind and study hard
Three meals a dayyour father plows and plants
Four seasons’ clothesyour mother sews and mends
Learn lines of verse and rhythmic prose by heart
Keep histories and classics near at hand
Some day your name shall top the honor roll
you'll be your parents’ pride your teacher’s joy
31 Officialdom
In age I boast not many scores of years
yet I have witnessed changes through three reigns'
In life’s arena fame dwells next to shame
born into dust you cry before you laugh
With past events I’ve surfeited my eyes
on things to come I shall not waste my breath
Such is the high road of the worldI know
a man does what he must to be a man
32 A hero’s will
To roam the universe in length and breadth
To pay a man’s full dues and be a man
To work one’s will north and south east and west
To fare and fight one’s way across the seas
Who lacks a trade on earth But how to live
and leave on history a heart’s red stamp
Who yet can tell true glory from crass fame
How many see a hero still unsung
The time shall come when fighting mists and waves
his hand will steer the vessel through a storm
He will fill rivers up cut mountains down
and all the world shall know of his high deeds
At leisure he will stroll the royal road
and clap for joy his debts at last discharged
Unfettered idler he will tend
his bag of verse his gourd of wine
33 Drink and drown your cares
Thirtysix thousand dayshow long is that
To watch a moth’s brief pageant makes you laugh
Why stir and ask for mischief from the world
Toss off a cup or two and drown it all
To chase away life’s cares there’s only wine
a hundred schemes can’t match one idle hour
Under the autumn hedge gaze toward South Hills
when you glance back the ninesphere realm looks small
Present and past swirl through the universe
your flesh and bones appear to disappear
Who needs a thousand rigs ten thousand pecks
34 Good luck bad luck
Good luck bad luck are both the Maker’s works
wise men and fools can both instruct the world
Brood on what’s past and you will dull your wits
sharpen your mind and cut all sorrows off
Lulling your wife to sleep lie idle and hum verse
watching your children play sit stockstill and drink wine
Teach a few boys who yet can’t wipe their snoots
make sport with girls who have just learned to sing
Let anyone call you by names he cares to choose
A horse An ox Yes I’m a horse an ox
Indeed who’s better than the rest
35 The bird in a cage
In all the world one cage holds this small bird
whose eyes once roamed the space of winds and clouds
But why oh why did I get snared and caught
to brood to moan to mourn my gift of flight
I used to preen my feathers flap my wings
and now I sing of freedom in a jail
Orioles dip and dart by the north hedge
phoenixes chirp and coo on the south branch
Let carpers east and west all wag their tongues
at my first chance from bondage I'll break loose
Straightwinged I’ll soar and race toward yonder blue
T’ll smash my chains and visit that suncrow
Upon this earth who knows my heart
36 Last words
Today your servant will give back his head
Let him bequeath some lines to all the world
You'll see his towering body cut quite short
yet for a thousand years his name shall live
His crimson blood will stain the stage of kings
one stroke of red crossed out all his grand dreams
Beheader will you chop his head clean off
He’ll pay you for your service afterward
37 Catfish and Toad (Tré Céc)
Of old and now the world has tales to tell
strange stories making plain the universe
And animals who hardly know one whit
will argufy the cause and end of things
Long long ago HeCatfish and HeToad
once quarreled and provoked a bitter feud
HeToad had his own burrow by a lake
but proudly haunted halls and seats of power
Now when his pregnant wife had reached her term
she hopped into a pond where fish did live
