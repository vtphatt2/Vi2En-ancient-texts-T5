46 Carrying a cangue around the neck
Folks on both sides see what I’m bearing here
A moral burden yes and not a cangue
Beneath its weight the scholar’s shoulders stoop
around its neck the hero flaunts his pride
[ll die and go up north my name will shine
You live and stay down south it’s your disgrace
One wins or losesHeaven take the blame
Fuck you base traitors who dare laugh at me
47 Fleeing from bandits
The market breaks at sound of Western guns
Just one false movethe game of chess is lost
Children flee home to scurry here and there
Birds leave their nests to flutter back and forth
Calf Haven’s riches wash away like foam'
Deer Field’s roof thatch and tile go up in smoke
O turmoil quellers are you hiding now
Why let the little people bear this scourge
48 The storm
Where do you keep your armies O Wind God
Unleash your might and tumble ocean waves
Whip whipblow down all temples and all shrines
Roar roarbring down all forests and all hills
Beneath Mount Lu did Shun desert his path
Upon the Sui Liu Pang found his escape
May Heaven storm and sweep our kingdom clean
then put it back within its rightful bounds
49 Elegy for Truong Dinh
His fame rose like a billow in the south
Gécéng in battles echoed with his feats
His bullets made white devils’ warships throb
his sword cast glory on the Golden Gate’
The flag of justice Heaven’s yet to fell
the captain’s seal lies buried under earth
Why must brave men break down and shed salt tears
A murmured prayer is offered to his soul
50 Waiting for the east wind
All plants and flowers yearn for their east wind
O Lord of Spring do you know Where are you
No sign of geese through the cloudhung north pass
swallows’ hushed cries in twilit southern woods
To strangers our old realm is parceled out
must we and they live under this same sky
Wait till our holy sovereign’s grace shines through
a shower of rain will cleanse all streams and hills
51 The loyal horse
Suchuang a horse won fame throughout the world
By scoundrels caught it knew a woeful fate
It stamped its foot refused to eat Sung hay
it turned its head and neighed for its Liang stall
It would let no new master ride its back
it wanted its own king to hold the reins
responses to the west
A loyal horse remembered its old home
should men forget the country of their birth
52 A fisherman speaks his mind
Wise men of talent now and in the past
have never let ambition seal their doom
Highplaced you’re still no better than a slave
a plowman’s buffalo a rider’s horse
In evil times avoid officialdom
and spare yourself some pitfall or some net
Those who serve tigers running as their hounds
will feed the tigers when no hare is left
Beyond harm’s reach persist in your own sphere
some stream or sea none covets or disputes
Plying a paddle row your wicker boat
and catch a livelihood from dawn to dusk
Weave your own way through rivers’ zigs and zags
with fishing line and rod made of bamboo
Befriend the moon by night the wind by day
sing a gay tune enjoy a jar of wine
Drift past where cranes resort where oysters haunt
In nature take delight at ease and free
The fish and shrimp by Heaven sent abound
You eat your fillfor what else could you wish
53 A blind poet looks at the world outside
I'll try to look and see how far they’ll go
in tearing up in carving up this realm
They all run hustling after wealth and rank
lackeys at dawn by nightfall petty lords
they strut it speaking daggers with their eyes
The people are squeezed dry impressed by force
to build their mansions or to polish guns
All rogues and toadies jostle as they hail
those heathens who encroach upon our shores
Rice fields are littered with our battlekilled
blood flows or lies in pools stains hills and streams
Troops bluster on and grab our land our towns
roaring and stirring dust to dim the skies
Clouds glower winds howlthe ordered earth upheaves
with summer snows and winter thunderclaps
These days when light recedes and darkness spreads
all three bonds and five norms in disarray’
are nothing but a raveled skein of silk
Were Yi and Fu to live in these warped times
they would be hoeing gardens plowing fields
A scholar with no talent and no power
could I redress a world turned upside down
Stopped short in midcareer I’ve spent my nights
dreaming and praying for a Yao a Shun
I’ve failed the peopleyet deep in my heart
I yearn to help them in their hour of need
Before the country I must stand disgraced
my vow of public service I’ve betrayed
When I pronounce these words my tears well up
when will my sorrow ever know an end
I’ve read the Scriptures of the Unicorn
Heaven’s decree I’ll heed and shan’t appeal
Better to have both eyes obscured by mists
than to sit here and see the kingdom’s foes
Better to curse the void before your eyes
than to sit here and watch the people’s hell
Better to have a desert for your eyes
than foreign conquest and defeat at dusk
Better to have both eyes in pitchdark night
than warfare drowning this dear land in blood
Sooner be blind and honor your home cult
than see no worship of your ancestors
Sooner be blind and keep from foul repute
than have both eyes and feed on putrid meat
Sooner be blind and to yourself stay true
than keep both eyes and tamper with your hair
Why see and ape those creatures garbed in wool
and swagger bowing to no lord above
Why see and stirred by gold and flesh
unleash all lusts inviting Heaven’s scourge
Why see and race against the madding throng
Today’s reward will be tomorrow’s shame
Why see and throw all ethics to the winds
spurning old virtues flouting Heaven’s laws
I’ve seen what’s happened to the world outside
54 The old hound
Three virtues always grace the canine breed
Still when his teeth fall out a dog’s grown old
Chasing the deer of Ch’in his knees wore out
Scowling at apes from Ch’u his skin grew limp
No one will stop the foxes loose up north
Few can deter the bandits rife out west
Once spry and strong he used to roam the world
decrepit now he sallies forth no more
55 The old whore becomes a nun
The brothel echoes with the chime of bells
you twist and turn in bed then you wake up
Your boat of love will cross the sea of lust
your beauty’s waves must reach the Dhyana grove
Grab Wisdom’s sword and cleanse your filthy heart
tell Bodhi beads and weave your karmic fate
Your temple’s nice and cool with moon and wind4
no Buddha yet you live a god’s good life
56 The rice mill
For merit here below who equals it
To grind our rice all call upon the mill
Dauntless it copes with storms of wind and dust
unshaken it will take a hundred spins
To serve its lord it must wear out its teeth
Who made it so it chokes within its throat
It cares not if its stones have both worn down
because the foe’s still there it must fight on
57 The mosquito
Mosquito you are blessed with all nice things
What do you lack Why buzz still and complain
You’ve rested on jade mats and ivory beds
you’ve stroked and kissed rouged lips and powdered cheeks
You’ve not spared children you indulge your tastes
you’ve stung poor people filling up your paunch
When a good swatter someday comes to hand
I'll pay you for your crimes without a blink
58 Opera actors
Some rub their shingles others scratch their mange
a shabby lot for all their fine array
A loyalist’s red face displays white eyes
a sycophant’s black beard sports scraggly hairs
Though under rooftops they boast parasols
astride no horse they brandish and crack whips
Thespians folk say make up a faithless lot3
they daub their faces then trade knocks and thumps
59 On hearing the rail cry
Your voice griefladen lingers in the air
Were you the king of Shu who died long since
Your blood pours out on quiet summer nights
responses to the west
your soul takes flight as moonlight fades at dawn
Are you bemoaning spring now past and gone
Or is it your lost land you’re dreaming of
Whom are you calling crying through the night
You make a wanderer brood within his heart
60 To a statue
But what are you Sir Statue doing there
You’re standing still as rock and firm as bronze
For whom must you keep vigil day and night
How does our homeland fare Or don’t you know
61 The French national holiday
Hail peace and joy on earth Firecrackers snap
They’ve hoisted flags they’ve hung gay lanterns out
Big dames peer down their snoots at some boat race
small boys hunched up catch glimpses of a farce
Trusting its strength girls wigway on the swing
for money fellows climb the greasy pole
Praise those who stage this merriest of shows
The merrier the sorrier alas
62 At an exposition
The fair displays a hundred goods and wares
Uncanny crafts Undreamedof novelties
Not long ago they dug and bored through earth
Here you behold the cosmos in its spring
From distant lands strange artifacts for garb
Out of deep forests fabled birds and beasts
Our wretched country shows one work of art
a wooden mandarin all capped and gowned
63 The comedian gets a curtain lecture
An actor lived in the East Ward
One night in bed he asked his wife
T play a mandarin on stage
why don’t I seem to awe the world
Her anger brokeshe scolded him
You’re old enough but still a fool
No one has heard you thank the gods
or I could never show my face
The world’s no dupeit only fears
power of life and death not mere pretense
How could your feeble makebelieve
impress one single soul on earth
You’re just a pauper don’t forget
you scrape along by playing roles
A king means little on the boards
stage mandarins are mere buffoons
64 The widow’s reply to a matchmaker
I’ve lost my manI lie bereft of joy
bereft of him who fed me kept me warm
A neighbor plays matchmaker and suggests
I start my life afresh with some young lad
A youngster full of spirit may run wild
how can a woman getting old keep pace
Try as I would I could not please him long
our union soon or late would split apart
A widow weds again for roof and board
if he took off and left me bare and starved
what a disgrace My parents warned me once
to shun backalley trysts which would make talk
My friend is that the way you pity me
You kindly wish to help but that won’t work
If you love me then lend me rice and cloth
don’t ask me please to take another man
65 To a discarded fan
After three months of autumn chill
you’re lying tucked away unused
Your bones and muscles though ageworn
can still stir up a storm can’t they
This season’s ruled by waxing yin
all’s in abeyance and must wait
When the red sun shines forth once more
the world will then bid you come out
66 Shrimp
They are no lords no marquesses or dukes
yet they all brandish swords and sport long beards
They splash in water popping their red eyes
quite unaware their heads are full of shit
67 To a dead dog in the river
Alive you caught the hares and made them cry
now down the river your dead body bobs
Some streaks still faintly show upon your coat
a stench is all your name has left behind
Lamenting at your wake are fish and shrimp
escorting your remains are crows and hawks
Wait till a storm comes up and whips the waves
your flesh and bones will crumble into bits
68 Tomorrow should I fail
Tomorrow should I fail I'll go away’
In future folks remember our feast days
I’ve studied till rice boils yet won’t get cooked
exams taste hot like chilies in the mouth
To you my sons I’ll leave my lamp and books
I’ll count on you their mom to fill their pot
Kunghsi Merci I know all foreign tongues
if not to China I’ll run off to France
69 Newstyle examinations
They’re said to hold newstyle exams this year
You oldschool fogies take and pass em quick
No stonecarved glory but the world will talk
For their lead pencil throw away your brush
70 No thank you
My wife you claim that French is mere child’s play
you'll give me money pack me off to school
No thank you Thank you with cinquante bows
There’s no lead pencil in my forebears’ graves
71 What earthly use are these Confucian graphs
What earthly use are these Confucian graphs
Masters and doctors lie curled up and wilt
Why not take lessons and become a clerk
At night champagne at break of day cow’s milk
72 Lamenting the state of Confucian scholarship
It makes me sick the state of schooling now
of ten who learned Chinese some nine have quit
Salesgirls at idle bookstalls nod and doze
tutors in private households squirm on mats
Like chickens scholars quail before the fox
Writers take blowsand all to eat steamed rice
I’m not maligning fellow villagers
I mean the headman and his deputy
73 Actors
You’re good for nothing actors all
You scream and shriek you mouth and mug
None but the children can you fool
sad humbugs under masks of chalk
74 Poor and happy
On this whole earth who can compare with him
He’s worldlywise and plays the fool
Ashamed to live in these foul days
he holds his peace and hides a hero’s hand
Obscure he comes and goes at will
He craves no wealth he eyes no rank
Sometimes he sports a tuft of hair
sometimes he shaves his head
All by himself he sings wild songs
half in Chinese half in our tongue
He wears no hat lets sunshine tan his skin
He leaves his teeth undyed and white
to flash them at the world and laugh
He lets em bow and scrape through gates of power
who knows that bridleshy he’s free as air
Hemming and hawing he acts deaf and dumb
Joy bubbling up in him escapes as song
How many understand him here below
75 Looking far ahead
Through five night watches I’ve stayed wide awake
I’m looking far aheadI feel a jolt
To ancient wisdom people have gone blind
The human race may vanish quite wiped out
Hills mined for wealth will someday crumble down
Seas opened up for trade will tilt in time
Once hollowed out the earth will fade away
They say a comet’s started whirling round
76 Drought
These days the sun could melt both gold and stone'
The people wild and frantic pray for rain
In happier times carefree they ate and slept
now waterless they tremble for their land
Glad buffalo don’t have to plow cracked earth
aghast the fish leap out and flee dry ponds
Each one must cope with drought in his own way
a makeshift fan I’m fluttering by myself
77 A man has lost his way
He’s standing here alonea stray a waif
He’s waitingwill he meet a friend or guide
responses to the west
The streams and hills are empty of all life’
Some strangers shuffle past forlorn and wan
He’s seeking men but only sees blue clouds
He’ll tarry for the tide till he grows gray
Who will show him the path through this vast world
How long how long must he stand here and wait
78 Best wishes for the New Year
Hear ’em exchange best wishes at New Year’s
They’ll live to be a hundred grow white hair
I'll sell ’em betel mortars and get rich
too old to chew they all will grind their quids
Hear ’em They wish each other lofty rank
They’ll purchase titles and official posts
This time I’ll go and sell ’em parasols
T’ll curse and cry my wares and they will buy
Hear ’em again They wish each other wealth
Where will they hoard their bulging millions though
This time the chickens will be moneyfed
they’ll peck at silver coins dropped here and there
They wish each other many sons and heirs
by fives and sevens children will be born
More folk and yet more folk will choke the streets
with babes in arms they’ll migrate to the hills
T’ll join wellwishers and convey my wish
T’ll wish all people of the world one thing
May kings and mandarins may each and all
learn how to live such lives as men should live
79 The Lake of the Returned Sword
The tower’s reflection swims amid the waves
A little bridge rests on a hillock’s slope
Clear waterof the magic sword no trace
Broad pathfrom Buddha’s shrine one relic’s left
For then and now a picture hangs on view
Things shift and changea flash and twilight falls
The lake’s still there to mirror ebb and flow
When will the waning moon wax full again
80 Flood
Rains pour shower upon shower winds blow by gusts
the rivers and the mountains lie submerged
Ants good for nothing wash away in droves
driftwood unused floats downstream like a raft
You hear birds peep and cry in lonesome woods
you see dogs climb and lord it on high beds
How can you bear to watch the people drown
O King Hsia Yii flood tamer where are you
81 Prison life
T’ve knocked about the world worn out my legs
to let me rest kind Heaven keeps me here
Where is the homeland Does it still exist
What is this place I stand and sit by turns
Some three square metersair enough to breathe
Four walls aroundthe moonlight wriggles in
There’s freedom in my little truered heart
Put me in chains and shacklesI don’t care
